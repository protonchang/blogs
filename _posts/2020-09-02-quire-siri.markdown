![Siri for Quire]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/Quire_siri_iOS.png)

Three years ago, when Apple announced the iOS 11, we welcomed Siri on board! Now the pumpkin spice latte and sweater season is rolling around, also known as the time for Apple to announce its iOS 14, our Quire with Siri integration has also updated to be smarter as well.

All you have to do is to talk to Siri and we will take care of the rest! Don‚Äôt be shy! Every great story always starts with a simple ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù You don't even have to swipe right or left! Just a simple *"Hi Siri"* will work! üëãüëãüëã

First thing first, you have to allow Siri to work with Quire. 

![iOS Settings]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/siri_voice.png)

* Tap **Settings** on your iPhone home screen
* Tap **Siri & Search**
* Scroll down until you see **Quire** and tap on it
* Enable **Use with Ask Siri.** We encourage you to enable all of the options to have the best experience with Quire and Siri!
 
Okay, now you‚Äôre all set and ready to go!
 
First conversation is always the hardest, don‚Äôt worry. Start with one of these below options and you‚Äôre good to go:
 
* Add a task in Quire 
* Add a task on Quire 
* Remind me in Quire

Or if you have made up your mind about the task name along with the due date, just naturally say your command and we will help you add the task! 
 
* Remind me to [task name] [due date] in Quire! 
* Remind me to [task name] in Quire!

All of the new tasks will be added to My Tasks as ‚Äúpersonal tasks‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt know what personal tasks are, visit our [guide](https://quire.io/guide/my-tasks/#personal-tasks) to learn more about your private tasks! 

<p class="notice">Read more about <a href="https://quire.io/blog/p/Quire-my-tasks-guides-and-tips.html">the redesigned Quire My Tasks II</a>.</p>

You can also transfer the newly added tasks to a certain project using [Transfer](https://quire.io/guide/move-tasks/#transfer-a-task) function! 

When you go to your My Tasks in Quire, this is what you will see:
