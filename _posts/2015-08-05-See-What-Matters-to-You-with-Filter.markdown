Sometimes, when you are working on a project, you only want to focus on tasks that are of the uttermost importance to you at the moment, like see the ones you are responsible for, or the ones that are marked urgent.

One way to do this and not be distracted by the remaining tasks is via the “**filter**” function. Simply decide how you would like to see your tasks, and follow the steps.

## **First, click on the filter icon…**

By clicking on the filter icon below the project’s name, you will see a menu bar.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 83px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/1.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

There, you can choose what kinds of tasks you would like to see, group and filter them further.

Right now, you are only seeing your Active Tasks, tasks that have not yet been completed.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 304px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/2.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

If you want to see tasks that you have completed, click on “Active Tasks” and choose “Completed Tasks.”

<div style="width: 700px; height: 305px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/3.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Or if you want to see all of your tasks, both active and completed, choose “All Tasks” instead.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 605px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/4.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### Note: You can hide the menu bar by toggling the filter icon. The green dot indicates you are in a filtered mode.

<div style="width: 448px; height: 39px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/5.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Now, let us group and filter the tasks further.

---

## **When you group by…**

## Date

To see all your tasks ordered by due dates, choose group by “Date.”

<div style="width: 700px; height: 160px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/6.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

This is what you will see:

<div style="width: 700px; height: 283px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/7.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### Note: We group tasks into 4 categories: Overdue, Today, Due in 5 days and Later.

---

## Assignee

To see what tasks each assignee is or was responsible for, choose “Assignee” instead. This is what you will see:

<div style="width: 700px; height: 350px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/8.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### Note: You can click on “Clear” in the menu bar whenever you want to return to the default status, which is “Active Tasks” without any filtering.

<div style="width: 513px; height: 40px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/9.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

---

## **Next, when you filter by…**

## Tag

If you filter by, for example, Appetizer, from “Tags” like this:

<div style="width: 700px; height: 262px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/10.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

You will see all the tasks that are labeled with Appetizer under whoever is responsible.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 212px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/11.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

---

## Assigned to

If you choose, for example, Crystal, from “Assigned to” like this:

<div style="width: 700px; height: 209px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/12.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

You will see all the tasks that have been assigned to Crystal under Crystal.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 198px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/13.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Here, you can click on “+” to create a task:

<div style="width: 700px; height: 198px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/14.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

The task will be assigned to Crystal directly.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 225px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/15.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

## Assigned by

If you choose, for example, Crystal, from “Assigned by” like this:

<div style="width: 700px; height: 225px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/16.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

You will see all the tasks assigned by Crystal under whoever is responsible.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 287px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/17.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

## Created by

If you choose, for example, Crystal, again, from “Created by.”

<div style="width: 700px; height: 233px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/18.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

You will see all the tasks that have been created by Crystal under whoever is responsible.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 351px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/19.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

---

## Followed by me

If you want to see the tasks you are following, choose “Followed by me.”

<div style="width: 700px; height: 223px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/20.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

You will see all the tasks you are following under whoever is responsible.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 376px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/21.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### Note: You will automatically follow tasks created by you.

Now that you have learned the different ways to see your tasks, you can try them out and choose whichever combination fits your needs the best!
