Sometimes, users would like to focus on only one task and its subtasks on [Quire](https://quire.io/), especially when they have a long task list and want to hide all the other tasks from the screen. This is when the “drill down” (zoom in) feature comes in handy.

## Simply follow these steps:

### 1. Select a task in your project, and press Z to zoom in on it

<div style="max-width: 355px; max-height: 265px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/1.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### 2. Then, you will only see the task and its subtasks

<div style="max-width: 355px; max-height: 205px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/2.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

To further zoom in on a subtask, press the Down arrow key to select it and then press Z.

To zoom out, press A.
