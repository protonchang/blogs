[Todoist](https://quire.io/compare/todoist-alternatives) stands out as one of the [best to-do list apps](https://quire.io/compare/best-to-do-list-apps) amongst thousands of productivity apps and gets approvals from millions of users. But you’re not yet happy with Todoist, and you are looking for a change. 

For a solo user, Todoist might be all you need. But for a solo user who works with a complex project or for a small team, Todoist can only offer the most basic functionalities and features to help you out. The menial work can be done with Todoist, or basically through any other reminder apps. But you (and your team) deserve so much more than that.

You love the simplicity of Todoist interface and its powerful feature, but you’re here exploring Quire for a better experience. And what can we say? You’ve made the right choice and we’re more than happy to get you started right where you left off with Todoist.

>“I love how it’s easy to use. I love all of the features that are crafted with the sole purpose of helping you achieve your goals! I really like the simplicity of Quire which allows me to outline my thoughts powerfully and create organized plans that help me accomplish big projects!”
