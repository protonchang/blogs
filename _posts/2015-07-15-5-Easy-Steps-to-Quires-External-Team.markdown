Here is something useful for those of you who need outside help, like freelancers, to help you complete a task in your project: You can now easily (and safely) outsource the task with [Quire](https://quire.io/)’s new feature “**external team**.”

Before we move on, you can take a look at the overview to get an idea of what it is. Or we can just get straight to the hows:

***1. Click on the Assignee icon.***

<div style="width: 417px; height: 163px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/1.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

***2. Turn on the switch button besides “Assign an external team”.***

<div style="width: 418px; height: 198px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/2.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

***3. Click on “+ Add new team”.***

<div style="width: 427px; height: 124px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/3.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

***4. Enter a name for the external team.***

<div style="width: 478px; height: 286px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/4.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

***5. Add external member(s) by typing their emails and pressing Enter or clicking on +, then click on Create.***

<div style="width: 482px; height: 337px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/5.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

After you clicked on Create, you will return to your project.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 420px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/6.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### Note: When you assign a task to an external team, the assignee will always be the team even when it has only one external member.

Now, you are just one step away!

The external members you have invited will need to accept the email invitations you have just sent.

Once they have done so, you would have successfully assigned the task to them, and they would be able to start working on it.

When you work on your project, you will see the whole picture.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 259px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/7.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

And if you group by assignee, you will see the outsourced task under the external team’s name.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 176px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/8.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

When your external team work on the same project, they will see only the assigned task. So, you do not need to worry about them seeing your other tasks.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 182px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/9.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

That said, external members can still create subtasks under the assigned task and manage them.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 227px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/10.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

And so can you.

<div style="width: 700px; height: 224px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/11.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

“External team” is a useful feature for those of you who want to focus on the core tasks at hand while delegating those that are non-core to third parties without compromising your safety.

In our upcoming reports, we will go into more details of what you and your external members can do.
