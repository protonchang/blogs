![Quire Mobile App]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/Quire_mobile_hack.png)

Welcome to another episode of Brunch with Quire! It has been a while since we rolled out our [Mobile 5](https://quire.io/blog/p/introducing-new-mobile-app.html) with a whole new navigation system. We hope your life has been easier with the help from Quire Mobile! If not (ooooopsss! üòì ), probably you have overlooked and missed some of these mobile hacks! 

## 1. Quickly add the task by dragging the ‚Äú+‚Äù button

![Add a task]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/mobile_quick_add.gif)

The redesigned Quick Add function lets you quickly add your task to the desired position. Just drag the `+` button to the place where you would like your new task or subtask to be created, then you can directly type in the task name. 

## 2. Shake, shake, shake to turn on the Advanced Mode

![Advanced Mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/display_mode.gif)

Since the mobile screen doesn‚Äôt allow us to show too many details, we chose to hide some of the information that is not critical to your tasks. But if you would like to enable the **Advanced mode** to view more tasks‚Äô details, you can always shake your phone. 

The default display mode for Quire Mobile App is **Basic**. If shaking is too much work, you can simply change the default display mode to **Advanced** in the [Account Settings](https://quire.io/r/setting?tab=options) if needed!

## 3. Swipe to complete a task

![Complete a task]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/complete_task.gif)

Don‚Äôt tell us you‚Äôre an expert Quirean if you still go to the [detail panel](https://quire.io/guide/user-interface/#detail-panel) to complete a task! If you‚Äôre used to tapping the small circle at the beginning of the task name in the web version, you might be shocked to know that there‚Äôs a quicker way to complete a task in the Quire Mobile app. 

Just swipe all the way to the right and your task will be completed! If you only half-swipe your task, you can set the new status for your task.  

## 4. Slide the screen down to view a task‚Äôs path 

![View the task path]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/view_mobile_task_path.gif)

What is a task‚Äôs path - you might wonder. To put it in a simple way, a task's path can let you know where the task comes from, what the context of the task is and how the task is related to its parent task(s). 

If your display mode is **Basic** by default, you have to slide down on the task name in the detail panel to view the task‚Äôs path. However, if your display mode is set to **Advanced**, the task‚Äôs path is shown automatically. To hide the task‚Äôs path, you must turn off the **Advanced** mode by shaking the phone or do it in the [Account Settings](https://quire.io/r/setting?tab=options).

## 5. Add a task to Quire using Siri 

![Quire Siri]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/Quire_siri.png)

Who has time to manually type a task in Quire, right? We got your back! Just tell Siri your command and we will take care of the rest! 

* Remind me to [task name] [due date] in Quire!
* Remind me to [task name] in Quire!

Now a new task is already added to Quire and you‚Äôre all geared up to start a productive day! Don‚Äôt waste time on menial work like typing in a task, let Siri help you!

iOS smart assistant Siri can understand different languages, you just have to make sure to change the language in Siri settings accordingly. Don‚Äôt be shy! Start your first conversation with a simple ‚ÄúHi Siri!‚Äù

## 6. Pinch to zoom in and zoom out a task

![Zoom in a task]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/zoom_a_task.gif)

In case you don‚Äôt know this, in the browser version, you can use the shortcut `z` and `a` to zoom in and zoom out a task. But how can you do that with your phone? 

Simply pinch to zoom in and zoom out a task! This gesture can let you narrow down your never ending task list to a small section! Of course, you can take advantage of the [Quire Sublist](https://quire.io/guide/sublist-introduction/), but a quick way to zoom in and out never hurts your productivity!

## 7. Two different types of search 

![Search a task]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/Quire_mobile_search.png)

Your projects deserve two types of search, just sayin‚Äô! We know you might not even notice, but if you use the [search](https://quire.io/guide/blink-search/) in the Home view, you‚Äôre searching across projects and organizations. 

However, if you‚Äôre already accessed to a particular project and now you use the [search task](https://quire.io/guide/search-tasks/) function, you‚Äôre searching for the results within this project or this view only.
