2020 wasn’t the best year for most of us. With many uncertainties and an aura of panic all around, small businesses were the worst hit by the pandemic and quarantine situation. Well, it’s 2021, and there is a ray of hope that things will get back to normal.

So, if you are a small business owner looking to give a boost to your business and recover from the sudden blow caused by 2020, then this guide is perfect for you. Here are five tactics that small business owners can put to use to kickstart their business in 2021.

## Five tactics to kickstart your business and be on track in 2021

Remember, before you adopt this guide as your business bible, many other elements need to be taken care of. But these tactics would ensure that your business won’t suffer again if 2021 continues to suffer the impact of 2020.

### 1. Plan things ahead

[Planning](https://quire.io/blog/p/task-management-software-helps-productivity.html) is a crucial part if you are into entrepreneurship. Sticking to a plan can do wonders for your business. Make sure that you are prepared for whatever circumstances are to come.

But instead of devising a single plan, it's always a great idea to develop Plan B and Plan C. In this way, if something happens to your Plan A, you would be able to smoothly transition to a different plan, and your business shouldn’t be affected.

The time taken to devise the plans would be fruitful in the event of any unexpected situations, and you will still be able to get a grasp on your business and reap the benefits.

You can even advance your plans based on the current market trends. Set up a well-detailed calendar and order your store’s timing accordingly. Highlight out upcoming festivities or holidays and prepare for the time of increased sales. Likewise, be ready to modify the tactics to please the seasonal customers as well.

### 2. Thrive to provide an excellent customer experience

Customer is the king, and that popular proverb holds in the case of every business, no matter how big or small they are. The power of the customer is felt the most when they experience a negative service from your side. The damage inflicted through word of mouth is beyond measure, and it can completely ruin a small-scale business.

So, always strive to provide the best for your customers and make sure they leave with smiles from your stores. But don’t just stop there. Ensure that your customers have a great time utilizing your products/services, and you provide adequate support when they need it.

A product or service becomes memorable for the customers only when they enjoy a great experience from the start to the end of the shopping experience. If you ensure this, you have already succeeded in the game.

### 3. Make your presence felt online

When the pandemic hit, the worst affected were the small business owners with no online presence. People were forced to search for online options/delivery, and they couldn’t find their favorite stores there. So they had to look for alternative stores.

Start with creating a well-optimized website with an easy-to-type domain. Then try unifying your services at one spot and spread the word using digital marketing. If another pandemic hits, you should be prepared to sell your services online and make sure that the customers would never go for any of your competitors.

When the digital marketing scenario is concerned, you need to be where your customers are. If you are a B2B (Business to Business) company, you need to be more professional, and you must interact with the concerned authorities of your prospect companies.

Whereas if you are a B2C (Business 2 Consumer) business, you could be a little informal and constantly push out great content to get noticed by your customers.

### 4. Prepare an anti-bucket list

As a small business owner, you will already have prepared quite a number of [to-do-lists](https://quire.io/blog/p/Top-3-Online-To-Do-List-Software-Productivity-Tips.html) and bucket lists. But have you thought about an anti-bucket list? An anti-bucket list consists of things that you don’t need for your business.

When you start a business, you would be tempted to rope in a lot of things along with the things you need the most. Many a time, you might not need that extra air cooler for your office or that high-end oven for your bakery.

An anti-bucket list will help you end the splurging habit and divert your attention to the things that are needed the most. Once you have got a grip on the market, you can slowly upscale, and then rope in the things in your anti-bucket list that you think would benefit the business.

### 5. Continuously collect and analyze the data

The power of data analytics is immeasurable and widely felt. Everything around you is data, and your task is to find the right data that can boost your business. It would be difficult to hire a data analyst for your [small business](https://quire.io/blog/p/productivity-advice-from-enterpreneurs.html), but you can always try to read between those lines and figure out some trends that might help your business, one way or another.

Use data analytics to identify the target segment of customers. Exploit the data to understand what their taste is and what price they would pay to get the best. You can also use data analytics to improve your customer service and provide a ‘wow’ experience to your customers.

## Hope for a better year in 2021 but stay prepared

If you want to carve a name for yourself and your business, you need to take some or other kind of risks. But that doesn’t mean you jump into a pit hole hoping to find gold. Proper risk assessments, combined with the required data analysis, would keep you going and give your business the much-needed boost.

Also, try to reinvent your business tactics and refine your plans to increase the overall [productivity](https://quire.io) and outcome of your efforts. Nothing comes too easy, and all efforts reap benefits, sooner or later.
