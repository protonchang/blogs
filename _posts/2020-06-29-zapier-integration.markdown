The 21st century is all about automating the workflow to optimize team’s productivity! Zapier was born to instantly connect thousands of apps so they can work together and ultimately help users simplify their workflows. 

Quire is a [task management software](https://quire.io/compare/best-task-management-software-for-creative-teams) that aims to help you achieve all of your dreams. However, in some certain cases, Quire alone may be not enough to help you get things done. You have to rely on one or two more apps to build the most complete workflow. For example, before when you receive an email, you have to open Quire and manually create a new task by copy and paste, then assign a tag for the task. Now with Zapier, all of the routine repetitive tasks can be automated with a single click only, saving you all of the time and effort. 

## How do I start using Zapier?

1. Go to [Quire & Beyond](https://quire.io/apps).

	{% markdown %}![Quire API]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/quire_apps.png){% endmarkdown %}
	</div>

1.  Choose Zapier and click on Install.

## Which Zap can I do with Quire?

Before digging deeper into how you can automate the workflow between Quire and Zapier, you might want to learn how to speak Zapier language first. 

* **Zap:** A zap is an automated workflow between your favorite apps. 
* **Trigger:** A trigger is the event in an app that starts the Zap. 
* **Action:** An action is the event that completes the Zap. 

If you are working with your team members and they’re not exactly tech savvy, you can create the Zaps and share with them so they won’t have to do it on their own. 

Now you’re all set and ready to use your first Zap! Click on any of the Use this Zap buttons below!
