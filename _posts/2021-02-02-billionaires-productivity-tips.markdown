### 4. Warren Buffet

Warren Buffet’s journey to a billionaire makes you believe the story of the rabbit and turtle is true. He wasn’t a quick billionaire. He built his kingdom with lessons he learned in life and with patience.

One thing Buffet holds onto even after reaching the heights is his love for reading. He is a voracious reader, and whenever enquired, he would urge people to read and gain knowledge.

Another interesting habit that Warren Buffet follows is that he never spends unnecessarily. Even after becoming a billionaire, he lives in a simple house that he bought in the early 1950s. If you have closely observed his speeches, he always urges the youth to spend wisely and invest to grow their wealth.

Well, this simple yet powerful habit has surely helped him to become what he is now.

Oprah Winfrey is a household name and one of the most influential billionaires we ever had.

She is an early bird and loves to exercise a lot. Instead of the regular body workouts, she takes time to train her brain and relieve the stress. This is done in the morning, and all her day starts with a sequence of spiritual and mental exercises.

What stands out is that she has set a timeframe for everything – for herself, her family, and business.
