It is near the end of the year. You are probably getting ready for the Christmas and New Year holiday and planning your trip to the Santa Claus Village.

As such a joyous time approaches, we want to take this opportunity to thank all of you, and share some thoughts and facts before we call it a year.

## Looking Back…

### We listened to your voice.

We would not be here without you - awesome people who have taken the ride with us in 2016. You are making [Quire](https://quire.io/) as good as it can be.

Thank you Tristan for being with us from the beginning; Thank you Mauro for your insanely quick likes and retweets; Thank you Roberto for all the ideas and feedback you shared; Thank you Dimitrios for sharing that beautiful photo of your fireplace.

The list can go on but these are a few.

### You are what kept our spirit alive.

Throughout the year, we have users from the United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Brazil, France, Australia, Uganda, Egypt, Ethiopia and 158 other countries who are excited about [Quire](https://quire.io/).

We want to say thank you, thank you all for choosing, sharing, and inviting your teams to join Quire. We cannot express our gratitude enough.

Quire has been acknowledged by you as a simple and intuitive app for ideas as it helps you go all the way from planning, organizing to completing whatever goals or dreams you have with your colleagues or friends.

> “Simple, clean to organize tasks in a complex project.”<br>

We see it as our mission to get to know you. We talked to you with every chance we had, and responded to your feedback quicker than expected.

And it was from these that gave life to the [features](https://quire.io/best-task-management) you are enjoying right now.

### Yes, we made amazing features.

We are proud to say that [Quire](https://quire.io/) has been rocking hard. Just this year alone, we have accomplished so much.

Not to mention the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quire/fafnibnpfejgmleffgpnddkboddbipgm) which lets you access Quire from any webpage and the beautifully designed [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quire-task-manager-for-teams/id1095193897?mt=8) for your iPhone and iPad (and yes, an Android one will be available too).

Here are what we have done, at least the bigger ones, in case you missed them:

* [Multiple assignees](https://quire.io/blog/p/Time-to-break-the-myth-of-Multiple-Assignees-in-Task-Management.html)
* [Multiple drag & drop](https://quire.io/blog/p/A-plan-well-laid-a-party-well-played.html)
* [Start and due time](https://quire.io/blog/p/It-is-all-about-time-in-task-management.html)

* [Auto-add with @, #, <> and !](https://quire.io/blog/p/Type-it-while-you-think-it.html)
* [Right-click on task for context menu](https://quire.io/w/Getting_Started_with_Quire/111/)

## Looking Ahead…

We cannot wait till 2017 to come. Why? Because it will be an exciting year when we welcome the birth of Quire 2.0 - the best [Quire](https://quire.io/) ever made.

It is no surprise that tree list (aka outline) is everyone’s most beloved feature of all. Considering that breaking things down into small pieces is what people naturally do when they face a big challenge.

That said, you can easily end up with a growing long list of to-dos and they become difficult to manage and complete.

This is why in Quire Mark II (aka Quire 2.0), Quire will come with the whole package from easily capturing all your brilliant ideas, to turning them into a well-organized plan and completing its step-by-step actions in a timely manner.

To be a little more specific, you will be looking at outline plus kanban boards all wrapped in an even simpler and friendlier UI.

## What You Can Do Now…

It is December. You probably still have ideas dangling in your head.

Now is a good time to dump them out! Simply take about 30 minutes to jot them down and divide them into small pieces, before they disappear at the back of your head.

So, with a fresh new start in 2017, you can get a kick start in that brilliant plan of yours. In the best-ever-made Quire 2.0!

That is a wrap up of our year in 2016.

Without either of our incredible team and users, [Quire](https://quire.io/) would not be what it is today. So, thank you for loving it and staying with us.

Let’s dream big, and be different in 2017. Together!
