Humans are predominantly visual animals. We process visual information much better than we do non-visual ones. A lot of people manually add their tasks onto their Calendar once they are aware of the due dates so as to get a more visualized schedule. And it is for this reason, Quire has integrated with Google Calendar to help you do this automatically. Once you have imported a project and set a due date for a task, it will synchronize with your Google Calendar and have it displayed on the right date in a day’s time. You can then view visually which tasks are due this week or this month so you have a clear idea of what lies for you in the future.

> **How to import? So Easy!**

Simply follow 4 steps and you’ll have your tasks synced with your Google Calendar!

### 1. Go to a project's Options

<div style="max-width: 227px; max-height: 68px; margin: 0 auto;">
