We made a few enhancements in our organization member roles.

Both **Normal+** and **Normal** members can add projects in an organization, and when they do, they become Admins of the projects. The only difference is that Normal members cannot access other projects that they are not members of.

In summary, **Admin**, **Normal+** and **Limited+** members of an organization can access all projects in this organization. **Normal** and **Guest** members cannot.
