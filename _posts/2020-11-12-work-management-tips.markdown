Using [work management software](https://quire.io/blog/p/work-management-software.html) for [remote teams](https://quire.io/blog/p/8-best-tips-for-remote-teams-to-boost-productivity-at-virtual-office.html) is the easiest way to ensure all of your projects are carried out on time and to the client’s specifications.

The alternative is that you could work with multiple software tools, spreadsheets, and [meetings](https://quire.io/blog/p/3-proven-tips-on-how-to-run-effective-meetings-with-a-digital-to-do-list.html). Or, you could use an efficient work management software solution.

Meetings are necessary. But when all the information necessary is effectively communicated in a project outline, meetings can be short. Which is good for everyone.

Want to ensure everyone knows what their role is? With work management software, a project can be laid out with each team member knowing what’s expected of them. Having clear direction and purpose makes people more productive. Because they have clarity around what’s expected of them.

Work management software can also be accessed whenever and wherever necessary. This makes working with teams in different time zones a breeze.

After all, if all documentation is in one centralized location, there’s no reliance on someone being awake, and working, for [remote teams](https://quire.io/blog/p/work-from-home-tips.html) to carry on their work.

These are just some of the key benefits of using work management software for remote teams. In this blog post, we are going to delve a deeper into the 10 key benefits, and how the right work management software can help your business.

## The 10 key reasons why you want to use work management software with remote teams

When working with remote teams nothing is more important than clear communication, direction, and goals. If everyone knows what they’re doing and how that relates to the overarching goal, it improves productivity.

And who doesn’t want that?

There are many benefits to using [work management software](https://quire.io), here are the 10 key ones that explain why some many organizations are moving towards this type of software.

### 1. Establishing clear goals

Creating project objectives and goals is a necessary process. They help in identifying the destination as well as providing a roadmap for how to get there. This is more beneficial than just mindlessly completing tasks with no idea of what’s going on.

Which is why having clearly defined objectives and goals teams can better [improve productivity](https://quire.io/blog/p/productivity_myths_leadership.html). The right work management software can help with this process from start to finish with [setting priorities](https://quire.io/guide/set-priority/), [due dates](https://quire.io/guide/set-date-time/), [tasks](https://quire.io/guide/add-task/), and [sub-tasks](https://quire.io/guide/add-task/#add-a-subtask). This will help each remote team member to complete their tasks on time and to the project’s specifications.

### 2. One platform for all your needs

Gone are the days when [project managers](https://quire.io/blog/p/productivity-mistakes.html) needed different platforms and software to handle disparate parts of a project, and manage a team. The old approach, where you might need 10 different apps to manage projects and team members was known as the Frankenstein approach. And thankfully, it’s an outdated mode of operating.

Because with work management software, a clear channel for aspects of work can be kept. A place where all communication, documentation, attachments, and assigned tasks are in a centralized location.

This centralized location makes it far easier to get work done. As well as keeping track of who is doing what and where their progress is at. Having everything in one platform saves time, improves efficiencies, and reduces mistakes.

### 3. Improve team collaboration

The larger the team the easier it is to make mistakes. Also, the longer meetings can go for. Neither of which are necessarily ideal. By enabling everyone to communicate in one place for everything related to previous, current, and future projects, teams can have improved collaboration.

With so much information readily available, and the ability to comment on current tasks, upload attachments all in real time, this can minimize the need for lengthy meetings.

### 4. Bird’s eye view of projects

Work management software provides insight into the status of every project. This allows you, or the project manager, to know if any projects are in danger of falling behind, or if any team members need help. These insights will also help figure what must happen to prevent any projects not meeting their deadline.

Instead of someone becoming overwhelmed and falling behind, work management software allows priorities to be easily changed. If necessary, more team members can be diverted to complete tasks. This way, there’s no one person fending for themselves, [drowning in work](https://quire.io/blog/p/how-to-properly-take-a-break.html).

Everyone can help each other which is beneficial in ensuring a project is completed to specifications.

### 5. Improved teamwork

By improving collaboration, and ensuring everyone is able to pitch in and ensure a project is completed on time and to specifications, makes for better teamwork.

Tasks can be easily and quickly assigned. Most quality work management platforms have their own messaging system. This means team members can communicate together in the platform, check tasks and have a better understanding of what is expected of them.

### 6. Reduce the number of meetings

Most meetings are meaningless. And the ones that aren’t, could always be shorter. Too often the problems with meetings is that they don’t resolve anything, because people rock up to the meetings unprepared or unsure why they’re in the meeting.

[Work management software](https://quire.io/blog/p/transparency-in-communication.markdown.html) can help to solve this problem. With this software, all team members can know the status of a project, what’s left to do, and who needs to do it. It can also let you know about upcoming projects.

With all this information it can allow teams to come to meetings fully informed and prepared. The benefit of which is meetings can be used far more effectively. And they can be shorter. More targeted.

After all, not all team members need to show up to every meeting. By having access to current and future projects, a meeting can go from half and hour to 10 minutes. The information in the work management software may mean that only a select group of people need to attend the meeting, allowing everyone else to carry on with their work.

Not only does this make meetings more efficient—and possibly reduce the number of necessary meetings—but it improves how much time team members have to get their work done.

### 7. Better focus and direction

<div style="max-width: 380px; max-height: 333px; margin: 0 auto;">

![Focus]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/donna_suits.gif)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Staying focused is so important to the successful completion of a project. Project management tools in work management software makes it easier than ever to set priorities, and to keep up to date with what stage of the project everyone is working on.

With this functionality, you can better ensure your workflow continues to run smoothly.

### 8. Enhanced productivity

Work management software is all about making life easier. There are features such as: a Kanban board, nested task list, multiple assignees, peekaboo, and health stats.

The Kanban board is great for visualizing your workflow: instead of just having a task list, this gives you a visual overview so you better focus on your tasks.

A nested task list allows you to break a larger task into smaller, more manageable tasks.

[Peekaboo](https://quire.io/blog/p/Quire-Peekaboo-and-GTD-Methodology.html) is a function that allows you to hide currently non-actionable tasks so you only see what you need to do right now.

<p class="notice">Learn more about how to use <a href="https://quire.io/guide/peekaboo/">Peekaboo to better manage your task list</a>.</p>

Health stats provides an overview of how well each of your team members and projects are performing.

### 9. 24/7 access

When you are working with a remote team, it’s important that access to projects and the ability to update work is available all the time.

Which isn’t to say that work-life balance isn’t important. But if you’re working with people who are in a slightly different time zone, you want to ensure all work is readily available without the need for a certain team member to be logged in.

There’s nothing worse than when a remote worker is trying to access files only to find they’re either in someone’s email or saved to a local server. This reduces [productivity](https://quire.io/blog/p/7-productivity-tips-to-avoid-burnout-at-work.html) and can mess with project timelines.

With work management software, everything is readily available. And with a smartphone app, it’s easy for people to stay connected irrespective of whey they are working from.

### 10. Stay organized and productive

This last benefit is really a culmination of the previous nine. If you’re serious about successfully managing a remote team to [complete projects on time](https://quire.io/blog/p/5-tips-to-improve-time-management-skills.html) and to specifications, you want to use work management software.

Everything is conveniently located on one platform. No more sifting through emails and trawling through unwieldy spreadsheets. No more delays and uncertainty around team member responsibilities.

With work management software you, and your remote team, can stay organized and productive. For this project and the next.
