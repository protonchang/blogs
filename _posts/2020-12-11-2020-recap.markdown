2020 is an astounding year of disruption and transformation. We were asked to make some critical changes to our lives. Who would expect one day, out of the blue, remote work became a requirement for corporate lives. 

Nations locked down, enterprises went out of business, and people are grieving everywhere. While the disaster hasn’t come to an end yet, we still hope you will spend the last couple days of 2020 in peace, maybe eat some cookies and a hot meal while enjoying the invaluable time with friends and family ❤️ 

In the meantime, we’re going to look back and reflect on the journey of 2020 at Quire. What we have done, what we have achieved and what’s more on the horizon for 2021 🚀

We hope at least in the darkest hours, somehow Quire has been able to inspire you to become a little more peaceful and productive.

## A Brand-new Concept for a To-do List 📝

One day when our team was working on a Marketing campaign, one of us realized our task list has grown into a mile-long list over the time. 

It became too difficult to find the tasks that we needed to finish and using search functionality wasn’t productive enough. We then came up with the [Sublist](https://quire.io/guide/sublist-introduction/) concept. 

With a collaborative to-do list, you can create your own personalized sub-list view by dragging-and-dropping the tasks that matter to you, so that you won’t get distracted and overwhelmed by the scale of the project. 

You can work on the newly created sublist however you like, and all of the changes will be mirrored back to the main project list. 

To view the tasks in a big picture context, you can always switch between the focused sublist and the “master” list. The sublist feature lets you focus on tasks that matter and create your own personal “workspace” within one collaborative project.

## An Elevated and Powerful Experience with Quire Mobile 5.0 📱

Faster, more reliable, more powerful, more polished, are all we can talk about the new Quire Mobile 5.0 version that was introduced earlier this year. For the first time after releasing the first version of the mobile app, we have revamped everything about the interface and perfected the little details, as well as added more powerful features. 

We want to make sure our app is accessible to you no matter what you are working on at the moment. [Google Assistant](https://quire.io/blog/p/google-assistant.html) and [Siri](https://quire.io/blog/p/quire-siri.html) have been activated to make Quire app even smarter. Now you can work with your task list with voice-controlled technology!
