By laying out a limited number of tasks into columns, Kanban board helps you visualize the workflow in a short period of time. At the very basic level, Kanban board lets you have three columns that include many ‚Äústicky notes‚Äù within each column.

* To Do 
* Doing
* Completed

When you are working on your tasks with a Kanban board, chances are you will move the tasks around and use different ways to best visualize your workflow. So when you decide to split your original columns into different parallel lanes that represent some unique project milestones or workload, you are creating Kanban Swimlanes.

The most urgent tasks will be put in the top of the list, which indicates that your team must concentrate and give full devotion to those tasks. The highest priority tasks are also divided into different columns, based on the working statuses. With this new layout, you can now visualize your next coming steps and highlight what tasks need to be completed first.

### 2. Balancing team allocation effectively

Depending on the nature of your project and the size of the team, workload allocation is a crucial step to manage team productivity. Different team members play different roles in the team, therefore, a manager should create a Kanban Swimlane by sorting the task list by assignees to have the overview of the entire work process.

In the above example, you can tell Brent has to work on a lot of tasks, whilst Beverly has only one task. Obviously, as a team leader, you would have to balance out the workload between team members to improve the team productivity. 

### 3. Managing tasks based on the users‚Äô stories or phases

You can utilize the Kanban board by using the tags to sort your tasks. By separating the tasks based on each tag, you can measure the workload for each tag by looking at the swimlanes. 

For example, your team is working on the tasks for several different phases, you can create a specific tag for each phase then sort the tasks by the newly created tags. By creating the swimlanes for each tag, you decide which phase that needs to pay extra attention to. 
Kanban Board and Kanban Swimlanes are the future of productivity

Many agile project management experts have praised how a physical board and sticky notes have changed their work life. However, this low-tech approach only works if your team is working in the same building everyday. As many global companies decided to embrace the remote working culture, managers need to find a way to help teams envision their work process even when everyone is working with completely different time zones!
