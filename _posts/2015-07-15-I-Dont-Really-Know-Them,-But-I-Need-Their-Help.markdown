In reality, there is not just you and me. There is also them.

Yes, we can survive on our own, but there will definitely be times when we need other people’s help, especially with something we cannot handle, whether it is at work or at home.

But getting help can be a tricky thing. You would not want to have a plumber helping you repair a break in the bathroom and also going into your bedroom doing all sorts of crazy things you cannot even imagine.

And as a project manager, not only would you want a freelancer to only access tasks that are outsourced to him or her, you would also want to include the outsourced tasks into your project to see the whole picture.

This is where [Quire](https://quire.io/)’s “external team” feature comes in.

“External team” is a group of people who work on the task(s) you outsource to them.

To get an idea of what it is and what it does, take a look at the example below.

You want to promote your new product and you think having an animation video for it would help, so you outsource this task to an animation studio.

Having received the task, the animation studio would then break it down into smaller tasks like storyline and characters and decide who is responsible for what and when among their designers and artists.

While they are busy doing all that at their end, you and your team members would work on some other promotion strategies.

In this example, the animation studio is your external team, and the designers and artists are your external members.

You give them enough freedom to manage the assigned task, and, at the same time, making sure that they do not have the freedom to access your other tasks.

Overall, “external team” is a one-of-a-kind feature for those of you who want to stay worry-free and in control when getting outside help to help you finish a project.
