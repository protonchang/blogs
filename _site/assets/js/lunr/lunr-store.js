        "title": "The Complete Guide of 2-Minute Rule by James Clear",
        "excerpt": "   “A habit can make or break us”. It’s a quite popular saying and it is scary when you think about it. A habit or a mere hobby of yours might change your life for the good or bad!   While we are aware of all this, are we really taking the right step to refine our daily routine for the best? Well, if you find it hard to start a new habit or break one that you think is not right for you, the book Atomic Habits by James Clear would be of great help.   The book puts forwards a very simple, yet executable rule, the 2-minute rule that would help you stop the procrastinating habit and be on track. While you may not find some new, unheard concepts, the book breaks down the existing concepts into simple techniques, which can then be adopted into our daily life.   Read more on 7 billionaires and their habits that help them achieve their new year goals.   4 of the Powerful Concepts Detailed in the Book   While the book is an abundant source of motivation, here are 4 of the most powerful concepts that James Clear has detailed in the book. The 2-minute rule is the most famous one, but there are some aiding concepts in the book that will help you adopt the rule into your daily routine.   1. The 2-minute Rule to Stop Procrastinating   The 2-minute idea is simple and brilliant. It takes just 2 minutes to start a habit, and then it can be refined and modified to achieve the best results. When you think of a hobby or a habit, you always aim for perfection, and that concept itself puts you off. A habit is something you do on a daily basis; thus, perfection is achieved only if you make it a practice.    But what if you are repelled at the very thought of it. That’s where you can implement the 2-minute rule.   If you wish to incorporate reading into your daily routine, start by opening the book and reading a page. At first, you might not gain the momentum to turn the pages, but after two to three days, you would read more than a page. That itself signifies progress.   This theory applies to all your habits. If you wish to do something, start by doing the most primitive thing. Tie your shoes to start exercising daily. Cut out a spoon of sugar to omit sugar as a whole from your diet. The two-minute you use to start a habit can totally give the boost to keep you going.   The 2-minute rule actually works, and this is because when you start practicing something, it becomes a ritual or a part of your life. Slowly, but steadily you would see the progress and your day feels incomplete if you omit it.          2. Invest in a Habit for the Journey and not for the Destination   Another powerful concept put forward by the book is valuing the journey you undertake to make a change in your life rather than the whole change itself. Often people start a habit, considering the destination or the final outcome. This is one of the main reasons why we procrastinate or give up the habit midway as and when we fail to notice any change or progress.   Instead of getting compelled by the results, start a habit to enjoy the process. Fall in love with the journey, and you will get to live every moment you spend. Even though the concept is pretty old, the book would help you achieve the same instead of just brushing up on the topic.          3. The Concept of Lagging Measure   Very often we envision a result in our mind and then work forward it. The book compels us to measure what we have now and then work to improve it. Thus, instead of a fixed goal, you get to be a better version of yourself each day.   For example, if you are planning to study a certain topic, first measure your knowledge. The lagging measure of your studying habit is the knowledge you presently have. Thus, when you self-analyze your progress, you get the motivation to achieve something more than yesterday.    This alone would help you stop procrastinating, and you would surely love the journey involved.   4. Habits Maketh a Man’s Identity   One of the simple yet powerful messages of the book is this. A person’s habits make him and that slowly becomes your identity. The way you look after yourself and how you utilize the precious time molds you as a person and in the process, you unlock new and better versions of yourself.   The book also reminds you that an identity isn’t something that is carved on a stone. If you build habits that don’t contribute to your growing process, your identity or vibe won’t be positive. When you change your habits, you change your identity and this is certainly the most powerful message the book has to convey.   The latter three concepts when you think off actually is a continuation of the 2-minute rule envisioned by James Clear. Unless you start something, you can’t really progress in it. Once you see start seeing the progress, know that your body, mind, and soul have started accepting it as a part of you and you might even feel incomplete when you don’t do it a day.   How should I start practicing 2-minute rule?   Slowly, slowly, you get to reap the fruits of the trees you sowed, but starting the process, trusting and enjoying it is of utmost necessity. If you start an exercise routine merely for the sake of it, you are never going to accomplish what you have in mind. Enjoy the workout, trust yourself, and focus on the process. It becomes a habit and results are bound to pour in.   If you are contemplating whether to eat that tempting piece of cake in front of you as a cheat meal, remember the 2-minute rule. First, turn your head around and then walk away. It’s the small steps that matter. Small drops definitely make an ocean.  ",

        "title": "Introducing Quire iPad App ",
        "excerpt": "   We are more than excited to announce the release of our highly anticipated iPad native app! Our team has been working hard to redesign and refine the functionality that you already love with the web browser version and the simplicity of the iPhone app.    An Old but Gold Design with the App Interface   We both know how much you love the Quire Mobile 5.0 major redesign, but for the tablet’s larger screen, you might think the mobile interface design is not optimized yet. This is the reason why we have spent time to elevate the existing mobile app and bring the detail panel back side-by-side with the task list.        With the detail panel now shown next to the task list, ready when you need it, you can work on the task’s details while still in context with the full task list.    Achieve Your Goals in Your Way   With the native iPad app, Quire is perfect for you from taking quick notes during meetings to planning ahead for a product launch campaign.    With a larger screen, you can toggle on the Advanced mode (pressing ⌥ with keyboard or shaking the iPad) to view more details in your task list.    The new iPad app also has the bulk edit/delete option enabled as you long-press on a task to activate the multiple selection checkbox.    Also, this version will support the magic keyboard. Enjoy the smart shortcuts while using Quire!   Currently, the new iPad app only supports Tree view and Board view. If you would like to access the Timeline view, you might have to use the browser version.          Note: This iPad app version also works with Macbook M1. If you don’t use a Macbook M1 and would like to have a desktop app, please follow the instructions on this blog post.   That’s all we would like to share with you for our latest update! We hope you will have a lot of fun using Quire on iPad! Let us know what you think by tweeting us at @quire_io or send us an email at feedback@quire.io!   ",

        "title": "7 Billionaires and Their Habits That Help Them Achieve Their New Year Goals",
        "excerpt": "   Ever wondered how the richest of the rich manages to scale up their profit and welcome the very new year with the same zest and confidence? The answer is they live their life with perseverance and passion. Nothing’s too easy unless you work hard for it. Many of the billionaires seem to have accepted this as their motto early in their life and are reaping the benefits of the same now.   Want to be successful and achieve all those resolutions you have on your bucket lists? Here’s a list of the seven most famous billionaires and their habits that help them tick-off all their new year resolutions.   Read more on 15 Productivity Tips from Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Warren Buffet and Others   7 Famous Billionaires and Their Habits   1. Mark Zuckerberg   Mark Zuckerberg needs no introduction. This man is an inspiration to millions of youths around the world. One of the resolutions he makes every year is to stay fit and scale up his exercising habits. In the year 2018, he revealed that he plans to run a mile every day and eat clean and healthy food.    He also plans to master Mandarin Chinese. Apart from his personal passions and plans, his prime motive at the beginning of every year is to improve Facebook and expand its operations.   2. Elon Musk   Elon Musk is always in the news, either for some memes he ignited or for the new technologies he adopts in his Tesla vehicles. Earlier, there was news that he used to sleep on the floors of his factory when the Tesla Sedan 3 was under development. This definitely led his doctors to prescribe him a digital detox and a mindful sleep.    While these habits may not sound much exciting, remember, we are all on our phones, and a digital detox is the necessity of the hour. Nevertheless, to say, a mindful sleep has definitely helped Elon Musk. He has almost doubled up his net worth and is in the race to become the richest man in the world.   3. Bill Gates   Bill Gates has always stuck on the habits he developed at the early stage of his career as a businessman. Wondering what it is? He always believed in himself and he made it a habit. He always believes in the plan or idea is devised and is well aware that he alone is responsible for all the actions and their aftereffects.   This simple yet powerful realization fuels all his actions, and he admits that this is his secret mantra to success. Bill Gates also stands by the idea of being proactive at all times. The man is more inclined to generate a response to the stimulus than blaming the stimulus itself. What is more beautiful than turning the tides in your favor?          4. Warren Buffet   Warren Buffet’s journey to a billionaire makes you believe the story of the rabbit and turtle is true. He wasn’t a quick billionaire. He built his kingdom with lessons he learned in life and with patience.   One thing Buffet holds onto even after reaching the heights is his love for reading. He is a voracious reader, and whenever enquired, he would urge people to read and gain knowledge.   Another interesting habit that Warren Buffet follows is that he never spends unnecessarily. Even after becoming a billionaire, he lives in a simple house that he bought in the early 1950s. If you have closely observed his speeches, he always urges the youth to spend wisely and invest to grow their wealth.   Well, this simple yet powerful habit has surely helped him to become what he is now.   5. Mark Cuban   This entrepreneur and television persona have always believed in the concept of routines. Instead of trying out different habits or rituals, he holds onto a simple yet effective lifestyle that made him what he is today.   Mark Cuban indulges in activities that promote his mental well being and increase productivity. He wakes up early and maintains a fit schedule. He eats clean, meditates, and exercises to reduce stress and increase his energy quotient.   Well, that’s a bang on schedule to follow!   6. Jack Dorsey   The founder and CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, somewhat follow the principles and habits followed by Mark Cuban. He strongly believes in the power of meditation and resorts to it whenever he feels down, stressed, or agitated.   In order to exercise and meditate, Jack Dorsey wakes up at 5 in the morning. He kickstarts his day by exercising his body and mind, and this in turn boosts his energy level and productivity.   7. Oprah Winfrey   Oprah Winfrey is a household name and one of the most influential billionaires we ever had. When you look into her daily routine, you would be surprised to know that her day-to-day life is somewhat the same as what we follow, but more disciplined.   She is an early bird and loves to exercise a lot. Instead of the regular body workouts, she takes time to train her brain and relieve the stress. This is done in the morning, and all her day starts with a sequence of spiritual and mental exercises.   What stands out is that she has set a timeframe for everything – for herself, her family, and business. Thus, the secret to her growth is she finds time for everything and never mixes her professional life with her personal life. That’s a textbook example of how to grow and be happy at the same time!

You surely will be having any of these three expressions on your face. You must be thinking about how they managed to be what they are with those simple habits and routines.    The answer is simple: consistency. They developed a set of habits that would guide them to achieve their yearly or decade goals and worked to perfect it. They believed they could do it and slowly, but steadily, they built the empire that we see now.  ",

        "title": "Introducing Dynamic Timeline: Illustrate Team Schedule and Achieve Success",
        "excerpt": "   If you’ve been with Quire from day one, we can imagine how excited you are to see the title of this blog post. Finally, the long-awaited Gantt Chart, also known as Timeline, has made its first debut.    We’ve spent time discussing and developing a Timeline feature that actually helps you manage your projects in the most efficient and easiest way possible, instead of freaking you out with all the complexities of a traditional Gantt Chart.   A lot of trials and errors have been made and today, we’re proud to introduce the Dynamic Timeline feature to you.    Currently Timeline feature is also available for My Tasks and Smart Folder.   What is Timeline and Why Do We Need One?   Timeline (Gantt Chart) was born to answer three critical questions to project management:    Who is responsible for the tasks?  How long will these tasks last?  Which tasks should be prioritized first?    The traditional Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. Each bar in a Gantt chart represents a task in the project timeline and the length of the bar visualizes the time duration for completing the task.    Since all of the tasks are laid out in a calendar-like view, managers can get the bird’s eye picture of the current project status. A classic Gantt chart will show the task list timeline, start and end dates for the project, task dependencies, along with the responsible assignees.    However, since a Gantt chart can include many information in order to present as detailed messages as possible, users tend to feel overwhelmed and end up being clueless and even more confused.     That’s the main reason why it took our team so long to finally figure out a Timeline that is intuitive enough to get you started and powerful enough to keep up with your challenging projects.    Workload Management made easy with Quire Timeline   1. Schedule project agenda and plan ahead to stay prepared      On the upper right corner, before switching your project view to Timeline, make sure you have added start and due dates for your tasks. If you haven’t decided the schedule for your tasks yet, you can simply drag and arrange the timespan for completing the tasks.   Any project and its sublists can easily switch among Tree view, Board view and Timeline view.   With the Timeline view, each task will be mapping out its time duration. The Timeline is best to forecast the project that you’re working on to see if there’s any timing conflict or if your team is on track to meet the deadlines. You can easily drag to reschedule the time duration of the tasks for as long as they should take.   2. Stay in context with Nested Task List and Timeline   If you google “project management software with Timeline/Gantt Chart feature”, the results will drive you crazy. We don’t want to create another software with the same feature, just a different layout.    When you switch your list to Timeline view, we let you keep the nested task list in the left side and present the project timeline in the right hand side. Unlike other project management software, once you switch to Gantt view, you have to give up your list view. We understand a project context is essential for team members to execute and manage the tasks.       To better visualize the project, you can set colors to your tasks either by priority, tag or date. Many studies have shown that colors can make significant differences to how much you are willing to get started on the tasks.    The dot in the right hand side of the task name indicates the task color and you can hover over the dot to see the due date of the task. And if you click on the dot, it will bring you right to the task that you’re viewing in Timeline!   3. Monitor project resources and availability   Let’s say you’re working on a project with 10 more members and some of them are clearly falling behind the schedule. However, with a clear project timeline, managers or supervisors can immediately spot the obstacles that block the team success.       In the Timeline view, you can sort the tasks by Assignees and all of the tasks will be grouped by the assignees accordingly. With the tasks presented in the lane for each assignee, you can immediately know if the tasks are evenly distributed between team members, or need extra attention in order to meet the deadlines.   4. Customize Task List with Grid View      Since the timeline view can only show very limited details of the task list, you can tap on the timeline button and toggle on Grid View.    You can choose which task details you would like to  show on your list, the default selections are “Status”, “Priority”, “Assignee”, “Tags”, “Start”, and “Due”. After choosing which option you want to show, you can resize the column if needed.    How Quire Team Plans With Timeline 🚀   1. Project Manager and Dev Team use Timeline for Product Launches      Before rolling out a new feature, it requires a long time of brainstorming and scheduling and making arrangements to available resources. Quire Project Manager Jim has been working side-by-side with the Head of Development Team to stay updated on the development process. Jim will use Timeline then group all the task by tags, so that he can have a bird&#39;s eye view of the project.   If there are sudden changes in the product and the Dev Team requires more time to work on the details, Project Manager has to rearrange the product readiness to ensure that the product roadmap will not get affected. Jim uses Timeline to spot roadblocks and forecast the duration of a feature development process.    2. Head of Human Resources uses Timeline for Event Planning      Penny is Quire’s Head of HR department. Her job is very stressful with thousands of deadlines and details to keep track of. She needs to make sure every due date is met - it’s not as easy as ticking off a task in your checklist.    Penny uses Timeline (Month view, sort by date, Advanced mode) to visualize the events that will be happening in the next couple of weeks. With all of the tasks presenting in a timeline view, Penny can make sure she can proactively manage the communications and spot any timing issues before they happen.   Get Ready for a Game-changing Comprehensive Project Management Tool 🏆   Timeline is incredibly versatile - no matter if you are a project manager, marketing coordinator, CEO or a consultant. You can use Timeline to manage a long-term complex project that has thousands of tasks or a short-term project that involves a lot of collaboration.    If you’re working as a team, you cannot afford to manage your task list without a Timeline. Introduce your team members to Quire Timeline today and let them proactively plan their work and track the progress to ensure team’s success.    P.S.: It’s just the beginning of our Timeline journey and there will be a lot of potential aspects of this feature that we haven’t explored yet.

        "title": "Quire Kanban Board 2.0 - Visualize Team Progress from Multiple Perspectives",
        "excerpt": "   Since 2018 when we first introduced our Quire Mark III and Kanban Board officially joined force with Quire Nested Task List to become a powerful duo to tackle big projects and challenges. From small enterprise projects to large-scale initiatives, Quire Board made it even easier to share teams’ vision and achievements.    We have listened to users’ feedback and suggestions as well as continuously discussed internally to make the Quire Kanban Board even better. Today, we are happy to announce that Kanban Board 2.0 is here, ready to walk your dreams home from multiple perspectives 🚀🚀🚀   Toggle between Board and List View   Quire Kanban Board 2.0 still lets you get the bird’s eye view of your projects and manage team progress from start to finish with the traditional cards and columns. However, the new Kanban Board gives you more flexibility to work with any of your task list and sublists.   We understand not all of you are list maniac like us, so we let you have a customizeable default board view for every project. Now you can view and manage your task list from different angles, different prospects without selecting some tasks into a specific board.    We let you have the flexibility to switch among nested list view and Kanban board view and Timeline view (even more views to come in the future). With every project, you can have at least 3 different views to choose from.    On the right hand side of your list view, click on the Board icon and your tasks will be presented in the board layout.      Agile Approach with Kanban Board   You still want to get focused with several selected tasks in one board like the old times?  Sure! We’ve got you covered! However, instead of creating a board, you actually create a sublist from your Task List and choose the default view as “Board”. Then select the tasks you would like to add to the board.       The default columns are created based on the project’ statuses. You can drag and drop tasks between columns to set the new status, even rearrange the task order however you like to get the view that you need.       You and your teammates can keep switching back and forth between board and list views. One can work with a board view and the other one can work with a list view within the same project, best of both worlds!    Visualize Work-in-progress in your customizable columns   Quire Kanban Board 2.0 lets you flip up your task list and organize your boards by customizable column sections.        Visually project’s progress? Shuffle the board by status Keep up with the most critical tasks? Shuffle the board by priority Concerning with team allocations? Shuffle the board by assignee Categorizing different groups: Shuffle the board by tag Visualize project schedule? Shuffle the board by date    The new Kanban Board is flexible enough for you to customize whichever the views in however order you would like. Your workflow is now in your hand, with full control!    When working with Kanban Board, we love to rearrange the tasks by dragging and dropping the tasks between columns to create different swimlanes for better visualization.    How is Quire Team Currently Using Boards 2.0?   In case you’re wondering how we’re managing our projects with Kanban Board 2.0, here are some examples to inspire you to get creative with your boards!   Tracking different stages of different campaigns: from a Marketing perspective      As a Growth Marketer, it’s critical to get the birds’ eye views of everything going on with the marketing campaigns and the product’s development phases. Vicky - Quire’s Growth Marketer - uses Kanban Boards 2.0 to group her tasks into different boards like “Quire Thanksgiving Giveaway 2020 Campaign” or “Timeline 2021 Marketing Kit”. Within one board, she keeps categorizing tasks by different columns, and each column represents a different project stage, such as “Phase 1”, “Phase 2”, “Phase 3” .    This way, by looking at the boards, Vicky can know exactly what needs to be done for one particular campaign in the phase one time period. Meanwhile, when necessary, she can always switch back to the “master” list view to see the tasks in full context.   Collaborating between two departments: from Community Manager and Senior Engineers perspective.      As a Community Manager, Peggy needs to collect users’ suggestions and glitches feedback then report to the Developer Team so that they can get their hands on the bugs. Peggy usually creates a board that includes all of the bugs and another board for all of the suggestions from users.    Within the bug report board, she will assign the tasks to the developers who are in-charge then column by assignees. When the developers have fixed the bug, they will complete the tasks then Peggy will get notified that the bugs have been fixed.   Manage efforts based on date and priority: from an UI/UX designer perspective.      As a person who is familiar with tight deadlines, Jess needs a board that lays out all of the tasks and their detailed due dates and priorities for her. The most urgent tasks will be put in the “Urgent” column, which will immediately catch Jess’ attention and full devotion to those tasks.    Jess takes advantage of the dynamic filtering and sorting functionalities: she creates her own board and uses the combo “Column by priority” plus “Group by date” (you can call this a swimlane), Jess can plan ahead to see which tasks are falling behind then rearrange her time schedule.   Success is Built on How Well-planned You are 🎉   Kanban Board might not be a new term to productivity gurus. But sometimes you still need to get creative to best utilize your board’s endless possibilities. We’ve examined the best way to visualize our workflow with Kanban Board 2.0 and we hope you find our unique approach helpful to get things done and achieve your dreams!    How do you like the new Kanban Board 2.0? Let us know in the comment section below or tweet us at @quire.io!

        "title": "Top 5 Business Tactics to Take into 2021",
        "excerpt": "   2020 wasn’t the best year for most of us. With many uncertainties and an aura of panic all around, small businesses were the worst hit by the pandemic and quarantine situation. Well, it’s 2021, and there is a ray of hope that things will get back to normal.   So, if you are a small business owner looking to give a boost to your business and recover from the sudden blow caused by 2020, then this guide is perfect for you. Here are five tactics that small business owners can put to use to kickstart their business in 2021.   Five tactics to kickstart your business and be on track in 2021   Remember, before you adopt this guide as your business bible, many other elements need to be taken care of. But these tactics would ensure that your business won’t suffer again if 2021 continues to suffer the impact of 2020.   1. Plan things ahead   Planning is a crucial part if you are into entrepreneurship. Sticking to a plan can do wonders for your business. Make sure that you are prepared for whatever circumstances are to come.   But instead of devising a single plan, it&#39;s always a great idea to develop Plan B and Plan C. In this way, if something happens to your Plan A, you would be able to smoothly transition to a different plan, and your business shouldn’t be affected.   The time taken to devise the plans would be fruitful in the event of any unexpected situations, and you will still be able to get a grasp on your business and reap the benefits.   You can even advance your plans based on the current market trends. Set up a well-detailed calendar and order your store’s timing accordingly. Highlight out upcoming festivities or holidays and prepare for the time of increased sales. Likewise, be ready to modify the tactics to please the seasonal customers as well.   2. Thrive to provide an excellent customer experience   Customer is the king, and that popular proverb holds in the case of every business, no matter how big or small they are. The power of the customer is felt the most when they experience a negative service from your side. The damage inflicted through word of mouth is beyond measure, and it can completely ruin a small-scale business.   So, always strive to provide the best for your customers and make sure they leave with smiles from your stores. But don’t just stop there. Ensure that your customers have a great time utilizing your products/services, and you provide adequate support when they need it.   Read more on productivity advice from Quire Community Manager   A product or service becomes memorable for the customers only when they enjoy a great experience from the start to the end of the shopping experience. If you ensure this, you have already succeeded in the game.          3. Make your presence felt online   When the pandemic hit, the worst affected were the small business owners with no online presence. People were forced to search for online options/delivery, and they couldn’t find their favorite stores there. So they had to look for alternative stores.   Start with creating a well-optimized website with an easy-to-type domain. Then try unifying your services at one spot and spread the word using digital marketing. If another pandemic hits, you should be prepared to sell your services online and make sure that the customers would never go for any of your competitors.   When the digital marketing scenario is concerned, you need to be where your customers are. If you are a B2B (Business to Business) company, you need to be more professional, and you must interact with the concerned authorities of your prospect companies.   Whereas if you are a B2C (Business 2 Consumer) business, you could be a little informal and constantly push out great content to get noticed by your customers.   Read more on how to stay at home and still be productive   4. Prepare an anti-bucket list   As a small business owner, you will already have prepared quite a number of to-do-lists and bucket lists. But have you thought about an anti-bucket list? An anti-bucket list consists of things that you don’t need for your business.   When you start a business, you would be tempted to rope in a lot of things along with the things you need the most. Many a time, you might not need that extra air cooler for your office or that high-end oven for your bakery.   An anti-bucket list will help you end the splurging habit and divert your attention to the things that are needed the most. Once you have got a grip on the market, you can slowly upscale, and then rope in the things in your anti-bucket list that you think would benefit the business.   5. Continuously collect and analyze the data   The power of data analytics is immeasurable and widely felt. Everything around you is data, and your task is to find the right data that can boost your business. It would be difficult to hire a data analyst for your small business, but you can always try to read between those lines and figure out some trends that might help your business, one way or another.   Use data analytics to identify the target segment of customers. Exploit the data to understand what their taste is and what price they would pay to get the best. You can also use data analytics to improve your customer service and provide a ‘wow’ experience to your customers.   Hope for a better year in 2021 but stay prepared   If you want to carve a name for yourself and your business, you need to take some or other kind of risks. But that doesn’t mean you jump into a pit hole hoping to find gold. Proper risk assessments, combined with the required data analysis, would keep you going and give your business the much-needed boost.   Also, try to reinvent your business tactics and refine your plans to increase the overall productivity and outcome of your efforts. Nothing comes too easy, and all efforts reap benefits, sooner or later.  ",

        "title": "You're Bad at Time Management, But We Can Help You Fix It!",
        "excerpt": "   Time management is a crucial factor in the success of a business and, in general, your career. It is the method of planning and balancing time between different activities and using it efficiently.    Amidst challenges and tight deadlines, time management can help you finish tasks in record periods without burning out those involved. These reasons make it imperative to master time management skills.   This blog is going to explore the meaning of time management skills, in detail, with examples to help you understand the concept. Additionally, it will tell you how to use an underrated weapon- work management software, to boost your productivity without much effort.   What are Time Management Skills?   Time management skills can be considered an umbrella term for a variety of skills that help you manage your time effectively and thus, increase your productivity. Listed below are some of the most crucial time management skills:   Organization   Careful organization of tasks helps you create and maintain a clear picture in your head of everything you need to complete within a timeline. Staying organized helps you navigate through tasks and situations effectively.   A well-organized plan generally involves breaking down large, intimidating goals into smaller, easy-to-achieve tasks, enabling as well as encouraging you to achieve your goals on time, if not faster. Some of the ways you can stay organized are by maintaining diligent notes and keeping your calendar up-to-date.   It&#39;s often said that your environment is a reflection of your mind, which is mostly true. So, keeping a tidy, organized environment can do wonders for your time management skills.   Prioritization   Objective assessment of your responsibilities and tasks with subsequent prioritization is key for successful time management.   There are many ways to prioritize your tasks. You can categorize them by deciding which ones are simple, and completing those first, followed by the longer, more involved, extensive tasks. On the other hand, you may decide to prioritize your goals per their urgency after selecting the most time-sensitive tasks. In addition to that, you can also choose what you need to accomplish as per a particular task&#39;s importance.   A combination of the three methods works perfectly well, if not better.      Goal-setting   The first step for effective time management is defining your goals and objectives with a plan for them, i.e., setting your goals. Goal-setting allows you to understand your aims clearly, and the things you need to prioritize in order to achieve it.   You can view your end goal as the light at the end of a tunnel. Setting both short and long-term targets can help change your business&#39; efficiency positively.   Communication   Communication is key in every aspect of your life, including your business. Developing strong communication skills makes planning and flow of work smoother.   It helps you delegate with ease, allowing you to focus on the most important and relevant tasks. Needless to say, strong communication is an uber essential soft skill.   Planning   Planning is a fundamental time management skill. An elaborate record of meetings, tasks, and how you will go about the same helps you stick to your schedule. Efficient planning can easily skyrocket productivity.   Delegation   Managing multiple tasks simultaneously with more-than-satisfactory results is important. Delegate the tasks strategically and diligently to ensure all the goals are met well within deadlines.   Even if you are convinced that no one but you can perform a task as well as you, establish boundaries and practice delegating. This not only reduces your workload but also keeps you from burning out, which may cause problems further down the road.   Read more about how to use GTD Method to achieve highest productivity level.   Stress Management   Excellent time management is always important but staying attentive to your mental health is equally essential. It isn&#39;t always easy to navigate stress without somehow adding to it, leading to anxiety. Before it increases and causes serious problems, you have to find ways to minimize stress.   Find ways to include small breaks throughout the day, or treat yourself somehow for a task done well. On the surface, taking time to practice this may not seem as important as getting things done as fast as possible. However, managing stress is crucial for consistent productivity.   Read more about how to avoid burnout at work.   Flexibility   While it is vital to stick to a schedule as much as possible, you can&#39;t dismiss the possibility of unexpected hindrances. A task may take longer than you expect, or some unprecedented changes may occur.   Thus, keep a clear space in your schedule to adjust and incorporate last-minute changes whenever required.   Examples of Time Management    Swiftly adapting plans to changing circumstances.  Allotting time for certain tasks specifically.  Careful analysis of feasible processes and selecting the simplest method to accomplish a task.  Setting boundaries for duties and demands.  Tackling complex tasks when you have high energy and sharpest concentration.  Auditing the way time is spent.  Strictly avoiding procrastination.  Breaking down bigger goals into smaller tasks, one at a time.  Clearly defining break times.  Maintaining daily, weekly, and monthly &quot;to-do&quot; lists.  Creating schedules keeping all possible factors in mind.  Delegating tasks in a way that produces the best results for each job.  Religiously participating in stress-relieving activities during downtime for maximum energy while working.  Efficient meetings with strict time frames.  Strategic multitasking.  An organized, clean work area.  Grouping together similar tasks for reduced transition time.  Prioritizing duties, projects, etc., with respect to urgency and importance.  Reviewing performances in timely intervals and making changes accordingly.  Organizing digital as well as physical files for easier retrieval.  Sincere punctuality.    Using Work Management Software for Effective Time Management   The secret weapon mentioned earlier for effective time management is work management software. While people usually think of project management software for managing time and increasing productivity, it’s restricted to only projects.   Work management software, as defined by Gartner (World&#39;s top information technology research and advisory company), is a set of software products and services that apply workflow structure to the movement of information and the interaction of business and human worker processes that generate the information.   In simple words, it allows you to streamline work for maximum productivity of individuals and teams. A work management software allows the culmination of almost every point mentioned above for effective time management in a single platform.   Read more about  10 key benefits of using a work management software.   Ways in which you can use work management software to promote efficient time management are as follows:    Noting down clearly defined goals. Organizing and scheduling timings for meetings and more, well in advance. Getting an overview of all the tasks with deadlines. Prioritizing each task. Recording and analyzing the time spent, the results, as well as the performances. Simplifying delegation. Easily communicating and coordinating with team members and colleagues.   Conclusion   Taking the time out to perfect each time management skill helps your productivity as well as promotes the success of your company. Work management software may not eliminate every problem, but it can drastically reduce them, saving precious time and making management easy.  ",

        "excerpt": "   2020 is an astounding year of disruption and transformation. We were asked to make some critical changes to our lives. Who would expect one day, out of the blue, remote work became a requirement for corporate lives.    Nations locked down, enterprises went out of business, and people are grieving everywhere. While the disaster hasn’t come to an end yet, we still hope you will spend the last couple days of 2020 in peace, maybe eat some cookies and a hot meal while enjoying the invaluable time with friends and family ❤️    In the meantime, we’re going to look back and reflect on the journey of 2020 at Quire.

A Brand-new Concept for a To-do List 📝   One day when our team was working on a Marketing campaign, one of us realized our task list has grown into a mile-long list over the time.    It became too difficult to find the tasks that we needed to finish and using search functionality wasn’t productive enough. We then came up with the Sublist concept.    With a collaborative to-do list, you can create your own personalized sub-list view by dragging-and-dropping the tasks that matter to you, so that you won’t get distracted and overwhelmed by the scale of the project.    You can work on the newly created sublist however you like, and all of the changes will be mirrored back to the main project list.    To view the tasks in a big picture context, you can always switch between the focused sublist and the “master” list. The sublist feature lets you focus on tasks that matter and create your own personal “workspace” within one collaborative project.

        "title": "7 Productivity Rituals to Work Better Under Time Pressure",
        "excerpt": "   Between time sensitive tasks, daily curveballs, and the day-to-day pressure of KPIs and deadlines, it can be hard to stay productive in a busy, tough environment.   In many jobs it’s difficult to avoid stress. All you can really do is find ways of managing, or channelling the stress into being more productive and efficient.   But how do you do that?   Everyone wants to be more productive, but the day-to-day goings on can quickly throw all that out the window.   The simplest solution is to establish productivity rituals.   Productive rituals are habits you build which help you get through your day. There are many different types of productivity rituals, from what you do in the morning to how you manage your day, to your sleep schedule, and future planning.   There is no magic bullet.   No one-trick pony that will allow you to ‘hack’ your way to success.   Rituals are habits you have to build over time. And once you do that, you’ll be more productive. You will also be able to work better in time pressure situations.          7 productivity rituals that will help you work better under time pressure   What you do in the morning will impact how well you perform during the day. How you approach each moment will determine how well your day, week, month, etc. will go.   As everyone is different, we thought we would provide seven productivity rituals instead of just one. This way, you can find the one which works best for you and apply that to your day.   Of course, there’s nothing to say you can’t incorporate more than one of these into your daily routine.   Read more about 15 productivity tips from Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Warren Buffet and Others.   1. Get grounded   What you do in the morning will set the tone for the rest of the day. Not having a good morning can leave you feeling disorganized and overwhelmed for the day to come. This is why it is so important to have a morning routine that will help you get grounded for the rest of the day.   If you don’t have a morning ritual already, or you’re looking to refine or improve your current one, here are some steps you can do.    Write down what you do each morning, and then add what you’d like to do each morning.  Figure out roughly how much time you would need to get through everything on your list.  If necessary, you may need to change your wake-up time to accommodate this new list.  Give yourself at least 2 to 3 days to get used to your list before making any changes.  Adapt your morning routine until you’re comfortable with it, and it becomes a habit.    A morning ritual doesn’t need to be complex. It can be something as simple as getting up a little earlier to meditate for five to ten minutes, and then going for a jog or walk.   The idea is to start small, and slowly grow it as you become comfortable. Starting your day off like this can help you start your day with more physical and mental energy.   2. Prioritize your strategy/schedule   Not everything on your list is important. Not every task or errand is urgent. To work better with time pressure, you need to assess what’s on your plate for the day. Figure out what absolutely has to get done by the end of business, and what can wait—without consequence—for a quieter day.   By establishing a priority schedule and strategy list, you can better gain a holistic perspective on what needs to be done.   This list will also help you say no more.   Why is it important to say no more? Simply because saying yes to everything will not only slow you down, it’s also one of the biggest reasons people feel harassed and overworked.   With a prioritized list, you will be able to know if an incoming task is going to help, or hinder, you in meeting your deadlines. Saying no to unimportant tasks is crucial in staying on top of what’s necessary for your day.   Read more how to use GTD method to better prioritize to-do lists.   3. Stay in the moment   Tomorrow is tomorrow’s problem. Fretting and stressing about it will not help you work any faster. In fact, worrying about tomorrow is a good way of slowing yourself down.   The only way you can control tomorrow is by controlling right now. Don’t rush, don’t take shortcuts, and don’t lose sight of what’s important right now.   If you do find yourself stressing out a little bit, the best productivity ritual is this:   Pull back, slow down, take a breath, and stop. Just for a moment.   Then make a checklist, sketch out two to three things that you can do right now to help achieve your deadline. Not what you need to do tomorrow, not next week, but what you can do today.   This is not easy. But when you are self-aware enough, and present enough, you can turn this into a productivity ritual. And it’s a ritual that works to great effect when it comes to working successfully with time pressure.          4. Expect the occasional curveball   Unexpected things happen. All the time. Working in the now means being just malleable enough to go with what comes at you.   This ties into the above productivity ritual. By being able to stop and assess what it’s in front of you right now, it can allow you to assess each task or errand on how it fits into the overall strategy or goal you’re working on.   The way this can become a productivity ritual is by developing the capacity for handling, managing and controlling the pressure that comes your way.   By being mentally prepared for the occasional curveball, you’re less likely to procrastinate, get overwhelmed, and/or panic. Allowing you work better with time pressure in a variety of daily situations.   5. Avoid procrastinating   Procrastination is a bad habit. And it’s one usually resulting from a desire to avoid something. The problem being, of course, that you will eventually have to do the thing you’re avoiding. Or maybe it’s not the immediate task, but the next one you’re avoiding.   A lot of the time, accepting the inevitability of your situation is enough to interrupt the habit of procrastination. But like a lot of habits, it takes time to break.   The best way to break this habit, and leave it broken is to replace it with another habit.   For instance, breaking tasks down into smaller manageable pieces often makes work look more manageable and even easier to complete. Because you’re not looking at some large project, but rather the individual steps.   This is why creating a prioritized strategy/task list is such an effective productivity ritual. Everything is reduced to a series of simple steps that add up to the completion of an overarching goal.          6. Schedule breaks   The importance of regular breaks should not be underestimated. Very few people are able to concentrate for hours and hours on end.   There have been studies which show that taking short breaks each hour will not only help you focus better, but you will also be more productive.   Which is why scheduling breaks in your day is an important productivity ritual. Stepping away from your work for a few moments is the ideal way for you to relax and decompress. This will allow you to better concentrate and refocus on what you are working on right now.   Building a ritual of regular, short, scheduled breaks can work wonders to help improve your productivity when it matters.   7. Be prepared for tomorrow   Once you have finished for the day, and you no longer need to live in the now, it’s time to focus on tomorrow’s now. For the last part of your day, instead of mentally clocking off, now’s a good time to create that list for tomorrow.   Write out your goals for the following day, and include scheduled breaks in your to-do list. When creating your to-do list think about:    What tasks have to be completed by this time tomorrow?  What are your highest priorities?  Are there any issues that might occur? Or possible setbacks?    Writing out this list will help you mentally prepare for tomorrow. And it may help you to go home and relax knowing you’ve mapped out the next day, and you have an idea of what to expect.   The advantage of this is being relaxed when you go home can help you sleep better. Which will help you be more energetic the next day.   Work better under time pressure with the right productivity ritual for you   Working better with time pressure is a case of building the right productivity ritual or rituals for you.   Whether it’s the morning ritual to get your mentally and physically ready for the day. Or, it’s turning ‘be present’ into a habit that allows you to deal with the occasional curveball, and ensure you stay on top of your work.   The right productivity ritual will help you not only work better with time pressure, but it will help you be more productive in general.

        "title": "15 Productivity Tips from Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Warren Buffet and Others",
        "excerpt": "   Getting motivated to start a new endeavor can be easy, the thrill of the chase and the possibility of success can keep you going. But what happens when you get there? How do you stay motivated to keep going?   Entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Jeff Bezos all offer advice on how to be more productive. And stay productive.   The productivity tips and hacks to help you become more productive   Here are 15 tips and tricks to help you be productive every day. Now, some of these may go against conventional wisdom, but look at who’s doing them and their continued successes.   1. Google Doc meetings   Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, says Google Doc meetings are one the best ways to speed up the critical thinking process. That way is a Google Doc meeting.   It involves ten minutes of reading and commenting directly in the document. This allows everyone to be on the same page, and means the attendees can be in any location and still contribute meaningfully.   This process makes it easier for everyone to contribute, and doesn’t encourage bullies or time wasters. Essentially, reducing unnecessary talk and creating a space where meaning conversation and brainstorming can occur.   2. Sharpen focus by meditating   Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder, isn’t the only one who thinks meditation is an important productivity habit. Everyone from Jack Dorsey to the Ray Dalio (hedge fund billionaire) consistently meditate.   It’s a simple exercise to help improve focus and get mentally prepared for the day ahead. Some meditate daily, while Gates mediates about two or three times a week for about 10 minutes.   Gates has said that meditation helps him to pay attention to what thoughts are in his head, and it helps him gain a little distance and perspective. Which helps to improve his concentration.   3. Know when to say no   Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, said a key component of productivity was knowing when to say ‘no’. He believed that saying no is a great way to stay focused on what you’re currently working on.   Warren Buffett agrees with Jobs, saying that really successful people are different to successful people because they say ‘no’ to pretty much everything.          4. Make quick decisions   Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, has said that decisions should be made with about 70% of the information you wish you had. Because if you wait around for more, you’re probably going too slowly.   Bezos’ philosophy on the matter goes further: he believes making the right decision is less important than making a quick decision. And this is because many decisions can be reversed. So, if you’re wrong, there’s not a whole lot to lose.   So, as long as you’re good at correcting your bad decisions, being wrong can work out to be less costly than making the right decision slowly.   5. Get enough sleep   Bezos, Gates, Musk, Gary Vaynerchuck (co-founder of VaynerMedia) and other entrepreneurs all say they get as much sleep as they need. Bezos sleeps about eight hours a night; Gates says he needs about seven hours a night, and Musk gets about 6-7 hours of sleep.   Sleep deprivation is not conducive to productivity. It’s important that you figure out how much sleep you need and make that part of your routine to increase productivity.   6. Streamline your focus   Steve Jobs was a big proponent of this. And it is part of how he made Apple what it is today. Focus on one thing at a time.   Focus primarily on the foundation of what you are building, and ignore the peripheral tasks until you’ve finished. Once you’ve completed the main task, find the next main task and keep going. Everything else will follow.   Read more on top 8 productivity myths that you should avoid to become a great leader.   7. Create a routine and stick to it   Muhammad Ali, not an entrepreneur but one of the greatest boxers who ever lived, hated his training routine. Hated every minute of it. But he wanted to be the best. So, he stuck to it.   You need to create a schedule/routine that works for you and stuck to it. This will involve a fair bit of trial and error, but once you nail down a rhythm to your routine, it’ll become second nature and you’ll start to perform your routine with ease.   8. The art of multitasking   Conventional productivity wisdom says don’t multitask. After all, we just mentioned Jobs’ views of streamlining your focus.   However, Elon Musk disagrees. He works 15-hour days, runs three companies, has 5 children, and never stops working. He’ll be scanning invoices while taking meetings and sending emails—all the while texting his kids.   So, multitasking does work for some—it’s all a question of finding out what works for you, and sticking to that.   9. Know when to take a break   John D. Rockefeller, considered the wealthiest individual of all time, believed in naps, working at a leisurely pace, and not trying to cram something into every minute of every day.   He routinely took post-lunch, and post-dinner naps and paced himself. Rockefeller believed one could achieve more by working at an even pace and not trying to attempt too much.   Winston Churchill was another who believed in afternoon naps as a way of helping stay sharp and productive.   Read more on how to properly take a break.   10. Hold on to your passion   Walt Disney struggled financially in the beginning, after all, it’s not easy to help pioneer an entirely new industry. But his passion for storytelling and animation kept him going. It helped him stay productive through the emotional and financial setbacks.   If you keep your desire and passion for what you’re doing at the forefront of your thoughts you will better be able to keep going, stay motivated and remain productive.   Accept the inevitability of adversity and keep pushing through.          11. Make lists   All entrepreneurs already mentioned talk about making lists. Whether it’s goal setting or just a to-do list that you then share with others. This helps you stay accountable, which can help you stay motivated.   Making lists also helps you to prioritize and gain perspective. Steve Jobs said that he used to make a list of everything he wanted to do, looked at the most important, and ignored everything else until the most important task was completed.   12. Keep it simple   Warren Buffett has said that more often than not the simplest behavior is far more effective than complex, difficult behavior. This echoes the idea of streamlining your focus — don’t focus on 55 things at once, focus on a few things that will help you generate revenue, and hone in on them.   And it doesn’t need to be overly complicated. Often the simplest solution is the most effective, and the most profitable.   13. Always carry a notebook   Richard Branson, co-founder of Virgin Group, said that a notebook was one of the top five most important tools he carried with him on the road.   He uses it for everything from jotting down ideas, suggestions for problem solving, contacts, and more. Note taking is an incredibly useful productivity tool, as well as being useful creativity, memory, and new ideas.   Branson has said that if more leaders took notes, they would have more ideas, and probably more success.   Of course, if you don’t want to carry around a notebook, taking notes on your phone can also suffice. What’s important is building a habit of taking notes.          14. Write everything out   Amy Landino, American entrepreneur and best-selling author, takes Branson’s note taking one step further.   She said she writes everything down. Documenting everything from talking points that need to be discussed to any other bases that need to be covered. Once you have everything down, including deadlines, it’s just a case of reverse-engineering deadlines and other goals.    15. Give Yourself 15 minutes each morning   Similar to Rockefeller’s know when to take a break, this productivity tip from Landino is about starting your day on your terms. For some people it’s just about finding a few minutes to gather themselves.   Other people use it to meditate and get themselves into the appropriate mindset for the day.   Whatever you do, it’s an important part of productivity to get yourself in the right mindset for the day.   Not racing into the day like a whirlwind can actually make you more prepared. If you only go slow at one part of the day, make it the morning. It can help you be better switched on for the rest of the day.   Find what works for you   The caveat that goes with each of these tips is that they are what worked for the individual entrepreneur. Elon Musk is a successful multitasker, Steve Jobs believed in working on one thing at a time.   Rockefeller believed in working at a steady pace and napping a few times a day: others believe in working 15 hours a day.   Some meditate, others enjoy their morning coffee, tea, or gym session. Ali hated his training regime, but he knew it would help him to become a champion. All of them knew what they were/are passionate about and stuck to it.

        "title": "10 Key Benefits of Using a Work Management Software for Remote Teams",
        "excerpt": "   Using work management software for remote teams is the easiest way to ensure all of your projects are carried out on time and to the client’s specifications.   The alternative is that you could work with multiple software tools, spreadsheets, and meetings. Or, you could use an efficient work management software solution.   Meetings are necessary. But when all the information necessary is effectively communicated in a project outline, meetings can be short. Which is good for everyone.   Want to ensure everyone knows what their role is? With work management software, a project can be laid out with each team member knowing what’s expected of them. Having clear direction and purpose makes people more productive. Because they have clarity around what’s expected of them.   Work management software can also be accessed whenever and wherever necessary. This makes working with teams in different time zones a breeze.   After all, if all documentation is in one centralized location, there’s no reliance on someone being awake, and working, for remote teams to carry on their work.   These are just some of the key benefits of using work management software for remote teams. In this blog post, we are going to delve a deeper into the 10 key benefits, and how the right work management software can help your business.   Learn more about which work management software to choose for your team.          The 10 key reasons why you want to use work management software with remote teams   When working with remote teams nothing is more important than clear communication, direction, and goals. If everyone knows what they’re doing and how that relates to the overarching goal, it improves productivity.   And who doesn’t want that?   There are many benefits to using work management software, here are the 10 key ones that explain why some many organizations are moving towards this type of software.          1. Establishing clear goals   Creating project objectives and goals is a necessary process. They help in identifying the destination as well as providing a roadmap for how to get there. This is more beneficial than just mindlessly completing tasks with no idea of what’s going on.   Which is why having clearly defined objectives and goals teams can better improve productivity. The right work management software can help with this process from start to finish with setting priorities, due dates, tasks, and sub-tasks. This will help each remote team member to complete their tasks on time and to the project’s specifications.   2. One platform for all your needs   Gone are the days when project managers needed different platforms and software to handle disparate parts of a project, and manage a team. The old approach, where you might need 10 different apps to manage projects and team members was known as the Frankenstein approach. And thankfully, it’s an outdated mode of operating.   Because with work management software, a clear channel for aspects of work can be kept. A place where all communication, documentation, attachments, and assigned tasks are in a centralized location.   This centralized location makes it far easier to get work done. As well as keeping track of who is doing what and where their progress is at. Having everything in one platform saves time, improves efficiencies, and reduces mistakes.   3. Improve team collaboration   The larger the team the easier it is to make mistakes. Also, the longer meetings can go for. Neither of which are necessarily ideal. By enabling everyone to communicate in one place for everything related to previous, current, and future projects, teams can have improved collaboration.   With so much information readily available, and the ability to comment on current tasks, upload attachments all in real time, this can minimize the need for lengthy meetings.          4. Bird’s eye view of projects   Work management software provides insight into the status of every project. This allows you, or the project manager, to know if any projects are in danger of falling behind, or if any team members need help. These insights will also help figure what must happen to prevent any projects not meeting their deadline.   Instead of someone becoming overwhelmed and falling behind, work management software allows priorities to be easily changed. If necessary, more team members can be diverted to complete tasks. This way, there’s no one person fending for themselves, drowning in work.   Everyone can help each other which is beneficial in ensuring a project is completed to specifications.   5. Improved teamwork   By improving collaboration, and ensuring everyone is able to pitch in and ensure a project is completed on time and to specifications, makes for better teamwork.   Tasks can be easily and quickly assigned. Most quality work management platforms have their own messaging system. This means team members can communicate together in the platform, check tasks and have a better understanding of what is expected of them.   6. Reduce the number of meetings   Most meetings are meaningless. And the ones that aren’t, could always be shorter. Too often the problems with meetings is that they don’t resolve anything, because people rock up to the meetings unprepared or unsure why they’re in the meeting.   Work management software can help to solve this problem. With this software, all team members can know the status of a project, what’s left to do, and who needs to do it. It can also let you know about upcoming projects.   With all this information it can allow teams to come to meetings fully informed and prepared. The benefit of which is meetings can be used far more effectively. And they can be shorter. More targeted.   After all, not all team members need to show up to every meeting. By having access to current and future projects, a meeting can go from half and hour to 10 minutes. The information in the work management software may mean that only a select group of people need to attend the meeting, allowing everyone else to carry on with their work.   Not only does this make meetings more efficient—and possibly reduce the number of necessary meetings—but it improves how much time team members have to get their work done.   Read more on how to run effective meetings with just a digital to-do list.   7. Better focus and direction          Staying focused is so important to the successful completion of a project. Project management tools in work management software makes it easier than ever to set priorities, and to keep up to date with what stage of the project everyone is working on.   With this functionality, you can better ensure your workflow continues to run smoothly.   8. Enhanced productivity   Work management software is all about making life easier. There are features such as: a Kanban board, nested task list, multiple assignees, peekaboo, and health stats.   The Kanban board is great for visualizing your workflow: instead of just having a task list, this gives you a visual overview so you better focus on your tasks.   A nested task list allows you to break a larger task into smaller, more manageable tasks.   Peekaboo is a function that allows you to hide currently non-actionable tasks so you only see what you need to do right now.   Learn more about how to use Peekaboo to better manage your task list.   Health stats provides an overview of how well each of your team members and projects are performing.   9. 24/7 access   When you are working with a remote team, it’s important that access to projects and the ability to update work is available all the time.   Which isn’t to say that work-life balance isn’t important. But if you’re working with people who are in a slightly different time zone, you want to ensure all work is readily available without the need for a certain team member to be logged in.   There’s nothing worse than when a remote worker is trying to access files only to find they’re either in someone’s email or saved to a local server. This reduces productivity and can mess with project timelines.   With work management software, everything is readily available. And with a smartphone app, it’s easy for people to stay connected irrespective of whey they are working from.          10. Stay organized and productive   This last benefit is really a culmination of the previous nine. If you’re serious about successfully managing a remote team to complete projects on time and to specifications, you want to use work management software.   Everything is conveniently located on one platform. No more sifting through emails and trawling through unwieldy spreadsheets. No more delays and uncertainty around team member responsibilities.   With work management software you, and your remote team, can stay organized and productive. For this project and the next.   Why using work management software is the only way to work with remote teams   These 10 key benefits of work management software highlight exactly what one piece of software can do for your business.   It can save you time. Improve your team’s productivity and collaboration. One piece of software can help you keep track of what is happening, and where each team member is up to.   One piece of software can make managing a remote team a straightforward and rewarding experience that can help significantly improve your organization’s bottom line.   🎉 Gartner Digital Markets research reports highlight top-performing #software according to verified user reviews! 🚀 Quire is the most recommended best value software and we have the best customer support in 2020! 😎💯👏#productivity #TuesdayVibe #getthingsdone pic.twitter.com/x6fDXgfHOL &mdash; Quire (@quire_io) November 10, 2020   ",

        "title": "What is Work Management Software and Why Your Team Needs One",
        "excerpt": "   Oftentimes, project management and work management are used interchangeably. Which is because the words project and work are often considered synonymous.   The truth is: project management platforms and work management platforms are quite different. To put it simply, a project management platform covers your business’s needs for all things project-related.   But that’s all it does. Which is quite useful, especially for remote teams who need to easily coordinate project workflow.   Work management covers a whole lot more. Everything from planning and managing employees’ time, to controlling labor costs and improving efficiencies.   Both of these systems have their pros and cons. And both can provide value to a business.   In this blog post, we’re going to show you the differences between the two systems in more detail. And we’re going to show why your team needs a work management platform.   Find out which work management software best fits your team.   Project Management vs. Work Management   Project management is the application of skills, knowledge, techniques, and tools to plan activities in order to meet the requirements of a project. And, in this case, a project is time-sensitive ad-hoc work with a definite objective.   In other words, project management makes it easier to effectively manage projects from beginning up to delivery.   On the other side is operations management. This is a continuous process. The work is repetitive, and success is less a single objective, and more of moving targets. That is, success is measured by continually achieving growth.   The key difference between operations management and project management is how much change operations management created within a business.   Using project management can create sudden innovative change. Operations management, on the other hand, typically induces changes continuously.   It’s important to keep these two distinctions in mind as it helps to illustrate the differences between project management and work management platforms.          What is Work Management?   Now that we’ve established the difference between organizational and project management, work management will be easier to explain.   Work management involves managing the team, and an individual’s, workload and workflow. This applies for a project as well as any organizational operations.   The advantage of work management is that it can be used for some of a project’s core principles that are apart from the scope of project management.   Projects center on collaboration and teamwork. But to manage the individual, that requires work management. And, in truth, it would actually be better to call work management: teamwork management.   This approach (teamwork management) combines the processes and methods of work management with the tools and systems of project management to produce the best results for your business.   Read more about how to achieve the ultimate productivity with the deep work method.   Structure and Collaboration Provided by a Work Management System   The teamwork management system provides structure, and nurtures a more collaborative environment in the workplace. Even if you have remote workers.   The great thing about this type of system is that it helps with collaboration at the team, the department, and organizational levels.   In a nutshell the 3 major benefits of a work management system are:    Easy document sharing  Collaborative task management  Centralized team communication           Project Management Software’s Limitations   As we mentioned earlier, this software is limited by budget and by time. Additionally, they are seldom—if ever—useful for all that tasks that happen outside of a project. Since most systems are all about setting up and carrying out a specific project with a specific goal.   Which is why (team) work management software is so useful. It offers greater flexibility in its options and doesn’t revolve exclusively around projects. The advantage of this is it allows for collaboration and conversation on any organizationally-relevant topic.   With all this said: it really does raise one question. How does a business know which of these systems is right for them?   When to use a project management system and when to use a work management system?   Let’s take a quick look at when it’s a good time to use a project management system, and when it’s a good time to use work management.   Learn more about top 8 productivity myths for better leadership.   When to Use Project Management   Project management software can be quite useful for small to medium business. There are hundreds of options each filling a niche roll.  Some are designed for certain styles of execution and methodology, while others are designed to be all things to all people.   These software options are most useful if all your doing is working in project mode. For example: if you’re a project manager working with a remote and in-house team then project management software would be ideal for you.   That is, provided you have a project manager with solid knowledge of project management methodology.   When to Use Work Management Software   Work management software is ideal if your organization needs software that is more accessible for all team members. And is more flexible.   Also: it’s useful if your organization doesn’t revolve solely around projects, and has a fair amount of operational work which requires support.   Some work management tools aren’t as comprehensive as project management tools. This means that while they are able to be used for managing projects, they won’t be able to do so as comprehensively.   However, there are some (team) work management software systems that are able to provide all your project, and work, management needs.   Whenever you are considering which is more useful for your organization, think about this. What are the needs driving your business today? And how do you want your business to grow?   By answering these following two questions you will be in a better position to consider which of these options is right for your organization’s needs.   Why Your Team Needs a Work Management Platform?   But on to the part where we explain why your team really requires a work management platform over a project management platform.   While the majority of this post has been looking at what each can do and can’t do, we want to finish off by explaining why a work management platform is, in most cases, the ideal solution.   As we’ve mentioned, project management tools are ideal for discrete pieces of work. That is, if all you need is something to manage the project, and you aren’t too worried about collaboration and communication.   How a Work Management Platform can Fill in the Gaps?   A work management platform helps team members complete their tasks and keep track of what’s next. Which is what project management platforms do.   Work management takes it a step further.   Dependable systems and repeatable processes can be set up so that work doesn’t get lost. And once these are set up, they can be applied to all projects. Thereby saving time and improving efficiencies.   Further to that, work management tools are able to connect a team member’s tasks to your organization’s overall goals.   This is useful to help team members understand how their impacts the overall goal. And studies have shown that employees who understand how their work influences the company’s overall goals are twice as motivated as those who are kept in the dark.          6 Reasons Why Your Team Needs a Work Management Platform   There is really just one reason, and we’ll break that reason done into six parts. That one reason is instead of needing 3 to 5 pieces of software you can do it with just one: work management software.   These are 6 reasons why a work management platform is all your team needs:   1. Maintain control of your time   Tracking and monitoring the time you’re spending on non-project work provides a host of benefits. Everything being more self-aware of your efforts and how productive you’re being, to making more accurate time estimates for tasks.   2. Balance schedules   Resource scheduling provides complete insight into your team’s schedule. This means your team members won’t be overworked, and projects have a better chance of being completed on time.   Read more about how to achieve work-life balance.   3. Organize tasks   Work management platforms provide task, and subtask, management for multiple projects. As well as the ability to track, collaborate, and prioritize individual task lists.   4. Collaborate effectively   By having your team members work in one platform it greatly improves collaboration. And not just for a single project. The right work management platform allows team members to collaborate and communicate freely across tasks and projects.   This includes everything from leaving comments for feedback or sharing files across projects. Work management platforms provide far better and more efficient collaboration options.   5. Track your work   Keeping track of work in a reportable fashion is important on several levels. It helps you spot any issues, monitor progress, and importantly, it allows you to share information easily with stakeholders and clients.   6. Visualize the workflow   Most quality work management platforms have Kanban boards. These are a great way to segment and visualize all your tasks as they appear in different stages of the workflow.   A Kanban board allows you to drag and drop tasks and duties to the corresponding stage. It’s that simple.   Tips about how to best use Kanban Boards to boost productivity.   Suggested Work Management Platforms          Let’s get it straight - there’s no perfect work management software that can flawlessly magically help you organize tasks and achieve team goals, even if you’re willing to write a big, fat check to get the software subscriptions. Instead of searching for the perfect work management platform, you should consider a software that can meet most of your needs and also the budget without creating a huge learning curve among the team.   Take a close look at the problems you’re facing with your projects. There are tons of methodologies to increase productivity as well as optimize teamwork. Try out several task management software to know which one works best for your team. Sometimes, powerful and heavy features do more harm than good.   A project management platform is great for managing projects. But if you want to better manage your organization, your projects and your team, then a work management platform is the ideal solution.

        "title": "10 Tips for Transforming Into a High Performing Agile Team",
        "excerpt": "   Agile teams, like any, face their challenges. And while the agile method has often been discussed like a magic cure-all for organization and task efficiency, it’s got to be done properly in order to be successful.   Because the agile method is more than just a gimmick way of selling stuff. It is an efficient setup for businesses to use in order to boost productivity and cost-efficiencies.   However, if there is not enough communication, goal-setting, cooperation, and leadership, agile teams can fail just like any other.   Transform Your Team Into A High-performing Agile Team   Here are 10 tips to transform your team into a high-performing agile team that will meet all their goals in a timely, effective, cost-efficient manner.   These tips include: ensuring your team has a strong foundation, and a good culture of teamwork: remain goal orientated, always be willing to learn new things; make KPIs clear; keep the team busy, and; encourage innovation.   1. Establish a sturdy foundation   An agile team is one that works well together and enjoys working together as a team. So, it is necessary to integrate common values into the team. This is vital as it will help create a collaborative work culture. It will also help to bring your team together and encourage integration.   And since the agile method emphasizes the benefits of cross-functional teams working together, incorporating common values is an absolute must.   It is a well-known fact that as teams bond together and the dynamic of the group gels, team members are more productive and efficient. When we say the group gels, we really just mean that when people like working with others they tend to do better work. And more of it.

Create robust engineering practices   This is one of those concepts that sounds way fancier than it actually is. But, it is important to keep in mind the concept of the agile team started out in the I.T. world, so there is definitely going to be some lingering tech-jargon.   Creating robust engineering practices, in context to agile teams outside I.T., just means ensuring there is structure. That is all.   Making sure that each task, each goal, each KPI, has a clear series of steps. And that the structure of these steps is closely monitored, assessed, and optimized to get the best results.   The best way to create robust engineering practices is to have tasks lists with a set structure that can be implemented any time a certain task has to be done. This way there are fewer mistakes and more efficient output.   3. Maintain continuous mentoring   Communication is vital. Ensuring team members have access to an environment supportive of their professional growth is incredibly important. Without this, it can be hard for your team to stay motivated, or to stay on top of their game.   This is why it is necessary to create and nurture an environment where your team members can talk, provide constructive feedback, and have access to learn resources.   Access to this is necessary to increase knowledge and ensure everyone is on the same page. It also keeps people motivated.   You do not always have to get outside mentors. Sometimes your senior staff can be mentors to the newer members. You may find there are even times when new staff may inadvertently have something to teach the senior staff.   Another useful thing which can be done is create a network of knowledge sharing across the company and with a number of specialists.   Continuous communication can be carried out in team management software to enable your agile team to comment on tasks and projects in real time allowing everyone on the team to stay informed.   Learn more on what a team management software is and how it can help your team success.   4. Establish a multi-disciplinary team   The highest performing agile teams have people with a wide variety of skills, because it allows for work to be effectively accomplished.   It is necessary for a multi-disciplinary team to be highly motivated and have the accountability and authority to achieve whatever goals they’re given.   By having a multi-disciplinary or cross-functional team, they can provide results by combining their talents and skills.   🏆 Quire is featured in @Entrepreneur and @DZoneInc for one of the best Project Management Tools 😎🚀 Read more: https://t.co/5tgjcORKFE#productivity #TuesdayMotivation #Quireinspiration pic.twitter.com/eT01ivsCES &mdash; Quire (@quire_io) October 20, 2020    5. Ensure team knows the end goal/big picture   Do not leave your team in the dark as to why they are working on a particular set of tasks. Knowing how each task or assignment aligns with the end goal and the big picture helps teams work better.   This is because when people know the big picture, it allows them to make sure the work they are doing is done properly. Both for the task at hand, and for how that task fits into the end goal.   This is why it is so important to invest the necessary time to communicate the current goals and priorities and how they relate to the end goal.   Doing this will increase your team’s engagement with their work, and help them to improve ownership of their work.   With agile teams, this works by ensuring all members of the team discuss with each other their vision and goals. Which can be done quickly at the beginning of the week, or at the beginning of a new stage in the project in a brief meeting. By brief, we mean 5 or 10 minutes.   Sharing goals, and ensuring everyone is on the same page, is key to keeping an agile team performing at their best. Simply because constant communication and understanding where their work fits in the overall project helps foster creativity and innovation.   As well as helping everyone feel responsible not only for their work, but also for the project as a whole.   6. Enable team members to make their own decisions   Your team members are people. Not robots. So, if you want them to work effectively, you need to enable them to make their own decisions where necessary.   You can do this by presenting them with the bigger picture and then give them the freedom to work in a way that best suits them. And helps them to successfully contribute to the end goal.          7. Small teams are more efficient   For many projects small agile teams are more efficient. This is because they are often nimbler, and are able to collaborate and communicate easier.   A small team is about 5 to 7 people. If you have more than that, see if it’s possible to break them up into smaller groups to get the most effective work done.   8. Ensure team members have KPIs and can identify useful metrics   Quick caveat: KPIs need to be meaningful—and specific—to the agile team. There’s really no point in having generic KPIs based on vague metrics.   Also: find the right balance. Ultimately, the work needs to be done to specifications, but it cannot be bogged down by meaningless KPIs. By this we mean KPIs should be about metrics which help measure and boost the overall performance of the tasks or project.   Key performance indicators should be created in a way that measures genuine progress in achieving a goal.   Useful metrics are ones that allow the agile team to improve their work, but also communicate to management how successfully work is progressing.          9. Create time and space for innovation   In an ideal world, it would be nice for teams to be able to factor in 20% to 30% of their time for innovation and fun. This has been shown to help people stay fresh, contribute to your organization’s innovation, and keep morale high.   Different companies have different ways of approaching this. And letting team members blow off a little steam, as well as do a little creative brainstorming, has shown to help people feel more connected with their workplace.   It also helps motivate them to do better work consistently.   10. Keep the team busy   Idle teams tend to lose their motivation and their momentum. The best way to keep them motivated and to ensure work is being consistently completed is to ensure a steady stream of work is sent their way.   This can be done with agile project management and deep work method.   If there are always task lists set up and ready to be assigned, then when an agile team has finished one project, the next one is there ready and waiting for them.   The advantage of this is it allows teams to work on one project at a time efficiently. Another advantage is that by working through tasks lists it minimizes the risk of work piling up, or a team going from idle to under the pump.          Build a Strong Agile Team   These 10 tips are just some of the ways you transform your team into a high-performing agile team. And, if you are thinking about setting up an agile team, ensuring as many of these tips are in place first will help to build a strong agile team who can hit the ground running.   It is also a good idea to have a team management software that will help you with the organization and collaboration aspects necessary for a high-performing agile team.

        "title": "What is Agile Project Management and How Remote Teams Implement Agile With a Team Management Software",
        "excerpt": "   Agile project management started life as a methodology for software development. It put forth the idea that interacting with staff and clients is more important than processes and tools. Agile project management also prioritizes collaboration over contract negotiation; and being adaptive is better than blindly following a plan.   Which just makes sense. And you can see why this approach has been taken from the world of software development and implemented across a variety of fields.   In a world where being able to adapt to change has become the norm, companies who are able to adopt agile project management are far more likely to be consistently successful.   Especially when it comes to working in environments where new data and insights can be obtained easily. Ignoring new information because of a plan made 2 or 3 weeks ago is not good for long-term success.   Previously, change was ignored because it was deemed expensive, these days with the right team members and software, it’s easy to incorporate it into any project.   The ability to adapt to what’s in front of you right now, can ensure a project is completed on time, to budget, and to maximum effect.   Implementing Agile Project Management   As a philosophy, agile is all about empowering people, how they interact with others, and the constant delivery of value.   It empowers employees, encourages diverse ideas, and creates accountability. Agile also encourages continuous improvement and the benefits being released early. It makes feedback loops possible, so that decisions can be tested and assessed early.   The feedback loop and other benefits may not be possible in traditional project management scenarios, where the project is managed in a strict linear fashion.          The Core Values of Agile Project Management   There are 4 core values present in agile project management. These core values can be implemented by following 12 guiding principles.   Agile project management’s 4 core values:   1. People and communication over tools and processes   No matter how sophisticated technology becomes, humans will also be a vital part of project management. A company which relies too much on tools and processes may find themselves unable to adapt when situations and circumstances change.   2. Adaptable software instead of comprehensive documentation   Documentation is necessary, but it’s not the be-all and end-all. Having team management software that allows everyone to do their job, and makes it easy to change and keep everyone in the loop, is far more beneficial to the overall outcome.   3. Collaborating with customers rather than negotiating a contract   Too many businesses forget how important customers are. Indeed, they can be quite an important asset. By involving them during the project where necessary can help to make sure the end product is exactly what they are looking for.   4. Adapt to change instead of sticking with a plan   This core value is the biggest difference. Traditional project management is all about sticking to the plan. In the traditional model, the need for change was seen as bad planning, and expensive. So, it was avoided as much as possible.   By adapting to an agile approach, it makes change as necessary as possible. With a project being broken into small sections for review and change in course if required.   Read more on how a task management software can help thousands of businesses achieve higher productivity.   Agile Project Management’s 12 Principles   The whole basis of agile project management is that it can be altered and modified to suit each team and project. What that said, there are 12 general principles that should act as the cornerstone of all agile project management decisions.   The 12 guiding principles are:   1. Customer satisfaction   This needs to be the biggest priority. Customer satisfaction throughout the process of your project should be a main focus to ensure you meet their expectations and deliver on-time and to specifications.   2. Shifting requirements   A customer’s needs may change, even late into the project. By adapting the agile philosophy and processes, you can help improve the competitive advantage of the customer.   3. Frequent delivery of projects   Delivering projects consistently—either weekly or monthly—is ideal. The shorter the timescale the better.   4. Daily team coordination   Team members need to be able to collaborate and coordinate together each day when working on a project.          5. Find the right people for the project   When putting client projects together, you want the most motivated team members. You need to provide them with the support, and the work environment, they require to get the job done. Part of this means finding team members you trust enough to get the job done properly.   6. Face-to-face meetings   The most effective and efficient way of communication is face-to-face meetings. Especially, between different teams. If it’s not possible to do this in-person, then video conference calling is the obvious alternative.   Read more on 5 tips to improve time management skills for project managers.   7. Progress is in the final product   Sounds kind of obvious, right? But the final product truly is the final measure of progress.   8. Sustainable development   You’ll know if you’re following the agile philosophy because there will be sustainable development. Using this process, everyone should be capable of sustaining a consistent pace, for as long as this process is being followed.   9. Attention to detail   Consistent attention to detail—to good design and technical excellence—increases agility.   10. Simplicity   The simplest solution is often the best. Reducing the amount of unnecessary work, and fine-tuning processes is essential.   11. Self-organizing teams   You will find that teams that can organize themselves, and collaborate, will often produce the best quality of work.   12. Assess and evaluate   Teams need to regularly reflect on what they are doing and if there is a more efficient way to do the work. Then they need to refine what they are doing accordingly.   Why Team Management Software Helps a Remote Team Successfully Implement Agile Project Management   Agile project management requires constant communication, easy-to-track milestones, and the ability to constantly assess, refine and adapt to new information.   All of which can be difficult when some—or all—of your team is working remotely. With team management software, communication is made easy.          Constant communication has never been easier with team management software   As most of these software programs have their own internal messaging service. Keeping an open line of communication between everyone working on a project allows even those working remotely to stay in the loop and keep up to date with the project.   Not to mention the ability to comment on tasks in real time for those working on that task to see. This allows for team members working remotely to stay on track, and to make changes as necessary. Team managers can also set tasks so only certain team members can see them.   The advantage of this is it keeps others from being distracted, and allows each team member to focus on what they need to do.   Learn more about what a team management software is.   Easy-to-track milestones to ensure a project is on time   Milestones ensure that certain parts of a project are completed before the team moves on. The advantage of this being important steps in a project’s completion aren’t missed.   With team management software you can set up projects so that tasks must be completed in a certain order. Of course, if it becomes necessary, this can be changed to suit new information.   Easily assess, refine, and adapt to new information   With constant communication and easy-to-track milestones it makes assessing, refining and adapting simple.   Short face-to-face daily meetings allow everyone to stay up-to-date with what’s going on. Depending on the size of the team, you may want to give each member a minute or two to apprise the rest of the team what they’re working on and where they are.   Which helps to ensure everyone is on the right track and that the project is being completed correctly.   Read more about the productivity advice from Quire Community Manager.   These brief meetings will also allow team managers to assess what’s going on. If necessary, they may refine what people are doing, or what tasks need to be worked on next to make sure everything is going according to plan.   Not that the team manager needs to do this during the meeting. The idea of the meeting is to be short, get an update, and then allow everyone to go back to work. Once the meeting is over, a team manager can use team management software to refine certain people’s tasks to keep the project on track.   Additionally, if a team manager receives new information from the client, it is easy for them to open up the team management software and comment on tasks, change tasks, and update people all at the same time.   Team Management Software Enables Effortless Execution of Agile Project Management   In today’s business climate, being able to smoothly and effortlessly adapt to change is vital to success. And with team management software change doesn’t have to be expensive.   Working closely with clients and team members allows for a project to be completed on time, and to the client’s exact specifications.   To successfully implement agile project management in your business, finding the right team management software can make all the difference.

        "title": "10 Tips for How to Successfully Settle Into a New Job Post-Covid Job Loss",
        "excerpt": "   Losing a job is unpleasant. Especially with bills to pay. It creates uncertainty and doubt, not to mention a sense of hopelessness and despondency. But the bills keep coming and the desire to find work doesn’t wane.   And while you may find yourself procrastinating at first, you will eventually get into the rhythm of job hunting. After all, you haven’t got much choice.   Which leads to a job, when then leads to finding yourself the new person in an alien work environment.   Starting a new job during the coronavirus   Coronavirus-related job loss in America is estimated to have affected between 20 and 40 million people as of June. And while most have been forced to file for unemployment support, there are many who have managed to find a new job.   There are stories on sites like the New York Times, CNBC, and the BBC detailing what it’s like to start a new job in these crazy, trying times. About the odd sense of displacement that comes with starting a job remotely, and how there is actually more to adjust to, when working from home.   After all, when you’re in an office, it’s easy to be introduced around. Easy to ask questions, and quickly establish the chain of command and the level of expectations. Working remotely makes that difficult. Even if it’s part time in the office and part time at home, this can still be disorientating.   Read more on the advice for a Remote Team from Quire Community Manager.    And this can make it hard to get motivated and build momentum and settle into a routine.          10 tips to kickstart your week at a new job during a pandemic   It can be difficult to orientate yourself in a new job at the best of times. But during a global pandemic that’s forcing many companies to adapt or perish? Here are some tips for kickstarting your week in a new job. These tips will work whether your new job is in-office or remotely.   1. Take time to familiarize yourself   It pays to familiarize yourself as much as possible in your first weeks. If you’re in the office, this can be as simple as spending a few minutes with the colleagues closest to you and then slowing getting to know everyone else. This will help you get to know everyone, understand the lay of the land, and be beneficial as time goes on.   If you’re working remotely, this is a little harder to do. Most companies with remote workers use an internal messaging platform of one kind or another. Whether it’s simply Google’s messenger service, or a task management software’s internal messaging; it’s a good idea to get on and start introducing yourself.   While it may be harder to do remotely, it is ideal to talk with people and become as familiar as possible with your new workplace.   2. Leave preconceived notions at the door   While your past experience will have some value, it’s always a good idea to start your job fresh. Just because you did work a certain way in your last job, doesn’t mean that’s how your new job does things.   It pays to ask questions. Especially, ones about the proper way of delivering work, and processes that may be idiosyncratic to your new workplace. Pay close attention to any on-boarding or orientation material or introductory meetings you are given.   3. Take each induction meeting seriously   Right now, induction meetings are more important than ever before. Companies need new employees to understand how things are done in a way that allows them to hit the ground running.   The best thing you can do is to find who is going to be doing the induction and have a chat with them before-hand (if possible). Ask for suggestions, advice and what’s the most important thing to prioritize in your first weeks on the job.   Read more on how to run effective meetings with a digital to-do list.    4. Prioritize the important information   During the first few weeks keep a list of what you need to learn. It could be anything from new skills to general company-related information.   Obviously, some information needs to be prioritized first. For example, if the company uses particular software, like a task management software. It’s probably better if you pay attention and get to grips with that rather than memorizing everyone’s names and roles.   Task management software can be one of the most effective tools you come across. This will help get you organized and stay organized. The right task management software will also make it easier to communicate with colleagues and understand your role in a project.          5. Ask all the questions   The worst thing a new person can do is assume they have all the answers. Especially, if those answers are based on how they did it at their old job. When in a new place the easiest and surest way to get up to speed is task many, many questions.   This not only shows initiative, but it shows you care about getting things done properly the first time.   6. Find a long-term employee to befriend   When asking all the questions you can think of, it’s important you direct them at the right person. Ideally, you want some battle-hardened veteran of the workplace.   They’ve been there long enough to know what does work, what doesn’t work; and why. The veteran will know the office politics and lingo. They’ll have answers because they’ve been where you are. And, they’ve helped other new people already. Which means they are used to helping new people, and usually—sometimes begrudgingly—they are very good at it.   7. Get some one-on-one time with your boss   This is not always possible. But if you can get some one-on-one time with your boss, it can be an invaluable experience. Getting information and expectations directly from the horse’s mouth can be important for your continued success.   Knowing how often you should communicate with your boss, and in what format will put you in good stead.   It can also help humanize you to your new boss. Instead of just being another employee that HR or whoever hired, you became a tangible person rather than a name on the outgoing spend spreadsheet.          8. Accept lunch invites (or the present-day equivalent)   If you’re starting a job in-office and people invite you to lunch, do it. You can always eat your packed lunch another day.   Lunchtime is when people are more relaxed, and willing to talk. Also, accepting an invite demonstrates that you’re ready and willing to mingle with your colleagues. This is the ideal way of making a good impression.   9. Figure out where you can get some quick wins   Scoring quick wins can be a great way to show your value. Not only to your new company, but also to reassure yourself. Talking to veterans and bosses can be a great way to find out how to quickly and effectively make an impact with some wins early on.   Not only are quick wins good for the company, but they’re a good way to stay motivated.   10. Just be you   Cliché, but true. Being is hard enough without trying to be someone else. After all, this is your new job, your livelihood, being yourself is the easiest way of being consistent.    It will let people know what to expect today, tomorrow, and in a month from now.          Procrastination to productivity: how task management software can help you stay on track   One fear you may have as a new employee is not being able to justify your job. Especially if you have been made redundant from your previous work. Oddly enough, this can lead to procrastination if there’s not the right direction or transparency around what’s expected.   Because sometimes fear of failure causes people to freeze up. Instead of tackling what’s in front of them, they see everything that needs to be done, which makes prioritizing difficult. In the ten tips above, we have offered suggestions on how to cope with this.   Learn more on how to procrastinate properly.    How to be productive in your new job   But one way that is arguably the most helpful for both employer and employee is setting an agenda through task management software. It breaks down a project into lists and sublists, making sure the right people are assigned to each task. With internal chat features and other helpful productivity features, task management software is the easiest of integrating into a new work environment.   Where some new team members may be slow off the blocks, having a productivity tool specifically designed to ensure work is completed in the correct order and to the deadline is a great way of making it easy for new team members to slot in as efficient members of staff.   Setting your own agenda will also help you stay accountable and productive.          Learn new things and be the best professional version of yourself   This is why it’s so important to ask all the questions, and prioritizing learning any software your new job uses. By diving in and learning as much as possible, you can become as effective and efficient as you know you are.   If you follow these simple tips, you can have a much easier time settling into a new job successfully.  ",

        "title": "Brunch with Quire: Top 7 Quire Mobile Hacks to Make Your Life Easier",
        "excerpt": "   Welcome to another episode of Brunch with Quire! It has been a while since we rolled out our Mobile 5 with a whole new navigation system. We hope your life has been easier with the help from Quire Mobile! If not (ooooopsss! 😓 ), probably you have overlooked and missed some of these mobile hacks!    1. Quickly add the task by dragging the “+” button      The redesigned Quick Add function lets you quickly add your task to the desired position. Just drag the + button to the place where you would like your new task or subtask to be created, then you can directly type in the task name.    2. Shake, shake, shake to turn on the Advanced Mode      Since the mobile screen doesn’t allow us to show too many details, we chose to hide some of the information that is not critical to your tasks. But if you would like to enable the Advanced mode to view more tasks’ details, you can always shake your phone.    The default display mode for Quire Mobile App is Basic. If shaking is too much work, you can simply change the default display mode to Advanced in the Account Settings if needed!   Read more on how to use Advanced Mode in the browser version.    3. Swipe to complete a task      Don’t tell us you’re an expert Quirean if you still go to the detail panel to complete a task! If you’re used to tapping the small circle at the beginning of the task name in the web version, you might be shocked to know that there’s a quicker way to complete a task in the Quire Mobile app.    Just swipe all the way to the right and your task will be completed! If you only half-swipe your task, you can set the new status for your task.     4. Slide the screen down to view a task’s path      What is a task’s path - you might wonder. To put it in a simple way, a task&#39;s path can let you know where the task comes from, what the context of the task is and how the task is related to its parent task(s).    If your display mode is Basic by default, you have to slide down on the task name in the detail panel to view the task’s path. However, if your display mode is set to Advanced, the task’s path is shown automatically. To hide the task’s path, you must turn off the Advanced mode by shaking the phone or do it in the Account Settings.   5. Add a task to Quire using Siri      Who has time to manually type a task in Quire, right? We got your back! Just tell Siri your command and we will take care of the rest!     Remind me to [task name] [due date] in Quire! Remind me to [task name] in Quire!   Now a new task is already added to Quire and you’re all geared up to start a productive day! Don’t waste time on menial work like typing in a task, let Siri help you!   iOS smart assistant Siri can understand different languages, you just have to make sure to change the language in Siri settings accordingly. Don’t be shy! Start your first conversation with a simple “Hi Siri!”   Read more on how to use Quire with Siri.    6. Pinch to zoom in and zoom out a task      In case you don’t know this, in the browser version, you can use the shortcut z and a to zoom in and zoom out a task. But how can you do that with your phone?    Simply pinch to zoom in and zoom out a task! This gesture can let you narrow down your never ending task list to a small section! Of course, you can take advantage of the Quire Sublist, but a quick way to zoom in and out never hurts your productivity!   Read more on how Quire Sublist can boost your team and personal productivity.    7. Two different types of search      Your projects deserve two types of search, just sayin’! We know you might not even notice, but if you use the search in the Home view, you’re searching across projects and organizations.    However, if you’re already accessed to a particular project and now you use the search task function, you’re searching for the results within this project or this view only.

        "title": "You're Not Lazy! You Just Don't Know How to Procrastinate Properly",
        "excerpt": "   Procrastinating properly, or intentional procrastination, is not a bad thing. It’s just your mind’s natural expression of its desire for novelty and efficiency.   Industry and culture have evolved/changed much faster than the human brain. Since the industrial revolution, there’s been nothing but finding ways of doing things faster, and safer, and easier, and cheaper.   Which creates this need for constant motion. If you’re not doing something right now, you’re probably wasting your time. You could be doing something productive.   And if you aren’t, well then, you’re just lazy.   The obvious problem with this mentality is that it makes no sense. Our brains aren’t built to be switched on 24/7. First of all, we need sleep. That is not an option.   But second of all, most people crave novelty. They will instinctively go looking for something new and exciting and challenging and different. And the work they’re doing has got to mean something, otherwise what’s the point?   Most jobs are not conducive to people’s constant need for novelty and efficiency.   Because many jobs are either menial, repetitive, unimaginative, stationary, or some combination of these.   Which, to put it simply, means procrastinating is not a bad thing.   But that there is a right way of procrastinating (intentional procrastination), and a wrong way (being lazy). This article will look at the difference between intentional procrastination and being lazy (the wrong kind of procrastination).          The difference between intentional procrastination and being lazy   How you procrastinate is what matters. And it’s also how you can differentiate between intentional procrastination and being lazy.   Intentional procrastination may sound ironically aphoristic, or just a straight up oxymoronic. But it is not. At least, it’s not oxymoronic.   This type of procrastination has a purpose. It is, at least vicariously, helping you achieve your goal, while tricking your brain into thinking you are doing something else. Which, in a way, you are.   But importantly (and it’s in the name), for it to be intentional it must have a purpose. You must be using the time wisely to seemingly do something else.   An example of being lazy is: checking your email every 5 minutes in the hope something important will come up that’ll give you an excuse to stop what you’re doing.   You could easily use that time to do something meaningful, such as the job you’re meant to be completing.   But what about when you’re staring at a task and it just seems like anything else would be better right now?   How do you procrastinate your way back into a productive mindset?   There are two key ways you can do this:    Allowing for small bursts of procrastination, or purposeful delay.  Using the GTD method    A quick note on the use of procrastination:   If the word procrastination is putting you off, think about it as purposeful delay. And while most would argue it is splitting-hairs over semantics, one psychology professor said calling it purposeful delay was more accurate and honest than procrastination.   In fact, the psychology professor argued that “pleasant-sounding variations of the term [procrastination] can function like a gateway drug.” Essentially allowing people to rationalise their laziness as some sort of weird productivity hack.   But whether you want to call it intentional procrastination or purposeful delay, it does something very different from being lazy.   Procrastinating, or being lazy, by playing a few sneaky levels of Candy Crush, or checking social media is just wasteful. And you know it is. More often than not you will feel guilty about wasting time, although not while you are being lazy.   It’s afterwards when you look up and realize the work you were avoiding is still sitting there. Waiting. Inexorable. Inevitable. This is when guilt, shame, and other similar negative emotions set in.   Which is unhelpful, unproductive and can lead to further stress and procrastination.   Avoid feeling lazy by allowing for small bursts of procrastination   Scheduling in small bursts of procrastination can be useful. Give your brain a rest, change gears for a moment, and then come back to the task at hand refreshed and ready to go.   You will lose a little time, but you’ll gain motivation and a desire to keep going. Or, alternatively, if you know a job is going to take two hours, give yourself two and a half hours. This will account for all those little breaks, pauses, and distractions which inevitably occur during the work day.   By factoring these little procrastination bursts in, you won’t so feel bad about them, and you’ll be able to complete your work on time.          The GTD method   This is where it’s more purposeful delay than intentional procrastination.   The GTD method was popularized in a book by David Allen in 2001. The book is titled Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity. In this book, David Allen discusses how his GTD method can help you organize and optimize productivity. And in doing so, you can reduce stress and save time.   This methodology works by creating an open loop that includes all your tasks. Which isn’t to say it’s about trying to complete all your tasks at once. Quite the contrary. The idea is to better prioritize the tasks in front of you.   Instead of worrying about all the tasks you have to do, you focus on today’s tasks. And anything that’s not important today, you ignore until it does become important.   This way you successfully get through all your tasks by only focusing on what’s in front of you.   Read more on set up GTD Method in Quire to live a stress-free life.    The “Someday/Maybe” list: leave for tomorrow what cannot be done today   To do this, David Allen suggested putting the tasks which don’t need to be completed today in a place called “Someday/Maybe”. Now, not all tasks can be relegated to someday, and probably aren’t optional.   But the idea is that by stopping what you’re doing to prioritize your tasks list can actually make you more productive.   Technically, The GTD method means you’re procrastinating from the work you should be doing. But the benefit is that it helps you to focus on what’s important right now. Essentially helping you to refocus, and leave for tomorrow what cannot be done today.   Read more on Quire Peekaboo and GTD Methodology.    How the GTD method works   This method is a five-step process:      The first step - Capture is where you write everything down that’s clogging up your mind. Every distraction, and every task that’s on your mind. Don’t second guess yourself, don’t overthink it, just write down what comes to mind.   The second step - Clarify is where you process your list and decide what’s the most important. What do you need to get done today?   The third step - Organize is where you organize your tasks list by adding due dates, delegating tasks that can be delegated, and putting tasks in order of priority.   The fourth step - Review is what lets you have your small bursts of intentional procrastination. It’s the review phase where you frequently review your task list to see if it needs to be revised or updated.   The fifth step - Engage is where you go to work. You’ve parsed your list down to what needs to be completed today.   How to use team management software to procrastinate in the right way   Team management software, like Quire, allows you to assign tasks with tags, dates (for starting and completion) as well as the priority of the task.   If you want to put tasks to one side, or for them to act as a reference list, Quire’s Peekaboo feature allows you to put all distractions out of sight so you focus on what’s important now.   To ensure you are on the right track and keeping up with all deadlines, you can create overview reports. These allow you to see what has been done, and what is left to be done.   Again, if you’re looking for a way to do some intentional procrastinating, creating these overview reports are a great option.   So, you can see what’s important and what&#39;s important tomorrow&#39;s important, Quire has a Kanban board. This is where the tasks which need your immediate attention are placed. Which helps you to not become distracted or overwhelmed by how much worth there is to do.          Intentional procrastination is useful when done properly   Intentional procrastination, or purposeful delay, is an ideal way of combating that guilty feeling we sometimes get when we know we should be doing something else. That is, intentional procrastination allows us to do something small but meaningful that takes us—however briefly—away from the task we need a little mental break from.   With functions like Peekaboo and the Kanban board, team management software can help you procrastinate from a task in a way that still provides some value to your work week.   And at the end of the day, this is the most productive option. It’s far better than playing a couple of Candy Crush levels, with the added bonus of: you won’t feel guilty or worried about getting caught implementing the GTD method.        ",

        "title": "What is Team Management Software and Why Your Team Needs One Right Now",
        "excerpt": "   Team management software (TMS) helps increase productivity and improve a team’s overall quality of work. A good TMS solution is able to do this as it helps managers, and leaders, to better communicate, collaborate and manage team members.   The difference between team management software and personal task management software   Personal task management software tends to work best for an individual, or a small team. And the team wouldn’t want to be any bigger than 5 people before the software becomes unwieldy. That is, before you would need to upgrade to something more robust.   This is because personal task management software solutions aren’t designed to be used for anything bigger than start-ups and freelancers.   Which is why team management software is more effective for most businesses. This particular type of software allows for greater levels of organization, communication and collaboration for small-to-medium sized businesses.   The better team management software programs—like Quire—allow managers to more efficiently break down projects into tasks and subtasks for transparency and productivity.   Productivity because it allows each team member to see what they are working on and how it relates to the project as a whole. Which is also how it helps with productivity.   The 8 ways team management software can contribute to your business’ success   If you’re looking to reduce risk, better manage your tasks and projects, improve communication and collaboration, and reduce overall cost-per-project, team management software can help.   No matter how complex the project is. And no matter what level of communication is necessary: whether with an in-house team, an external team or collaborating with both, a team management software solution can help you and your team stay connected.          1. Complex project management   Team management software (TMS) delves deeper into complex project planning and tracking than personal task management software is capable of.   Of course, a project doesn’t need to be complex for your business to benefit from a TMS solution. This software can be used to create task lists and sublists for small projects, to ensure a project is completed correctly the first time.   And this software makes it easier to track and measure the overall progress of each team member and the project as a whole.   Some of what can be tracked and measured includes the more complex nuances of a project. These nuances include team communication, deadlines, and budget.   2. Agile task management   One of the biggest benefits of team management software is improving efficiencies. To do this, it’s necessary to find what is slowing you down, and resolve that.   The simplest way of achieving this is through effective to-do lists and efficiently delegating tasks.              To-do lists   TMS solutions feature interactive tasks lists that allow you to add all upcoming tasks. They also come with the option of setting reminders for deadlines. This helps prioritize task and to-do lists. It also enables you to maintain a bird’s eye view of tasks being completed. who’s completing them. And how long it’s taking.   Delegating tasks   Making sure the right team members complete the appropriate tasks doesn’t need to be time consuming. A TMS solution lets you assign tasks quickly.   And it will notify the team member that a task has been assigned to them in real time. With in-built messaging, you can easily communicate with your team to let them know what’s going on.   Shared tasks   Creating shared tasks, or adding a team member to a task, improves collaboration. When a task is assigned to multiple people, it will show up in all their tasks lists. Comments can be seen in real time, making it easier to track what each person is doing.   As well as seeing what each person is responsible for. This helps with accountability and progress reports. And making sure no one’s doubling up on work.   Read more on top 12 Quire hacks that make your productivity great again.    3. Team communication and collaboration   Building on from complex project management and agile task management, team communication and collaboration help further improve a team’s productivity and efficiency.   A TMS solution with built-in instant messaging is necessary for streamlined communication. It enables you and your team to discuss a task without having to open, or rely on, another messaging platform.   File sharing   Being able to share files in your TMS solution enhances collaboration by making all data is quickly and easily accessible from one place.   This is far more effective and practical than sending emails back and forth, or relying on spreadsheets for storing data. It can all be done using team management software.   4. Shared calendars and projects   Most TMS solutions allow you to integrate or sync your tasks with a calendar. The advantage of this is it&#39;s easier to track your projects and plan ahead.   You can also send calendar invites to both team members and clients, making it easier to keep on top of—and not miss any—meetings.   You can also share a view of the project with a client so they too can see the breakdown of the project. The key advantage of this is transparency. Your clients know what’s being worked on, and the deadlines to assure them everything will be completed to the deadline.          5. Task reporting   If you just need something to create and check off tasks, you can do that with any basic app. But what most successful businesses want is to be able to report on what has been done, and how it has been done.   The best team management software solutions give you access to detailed reports and effective tools to achieve the surest control over your team’s work.   Teamwork summary   The advantage of a team management software is that it, in addition to an outline of your current tasks, also provides an outline of work completed.   The advantage of this is that you can create detailed reports about sales, accounting and marketing.   Task reports   Tasks reports are good for accounting. Figuring how much time is being spent by who and on which assignments allows you to see which clients your team is spending the most time on.   So, if you’re billing your clients hourly, this report will be a transparent way of showing the work completed and how long it took.   Gain more insight with detailed reporting   All reports should be data-driven. The data you’re able to acquire, the more useful insight you will possess. This is why it’s so important to have a TMS solution that allows you to collect a large amount of data. This includes:    Time spent  Completed tasks  Related project data  Past events  Customer data    To get all this data, your team has to fill out all the information about their work as they go, accurately. The benefit of this is more data-driven decision making that can help to improve productivity and efficiencies.          6. Better understanding of your true resource capability   When you use team management software it provides you with clearer insight into your company’s overall resource capabilities.   As resource capability planning is a key factor in the success of a service or project. Using the TMS solution will help you to:    Optimize team workflows through capacity reporting and resource forecasts.  Look more closely at, and better analyze, why you go over budget. This will then help inform what you need to do differently next time.  Maximize just how far your budget can go.    Overall, using the right TMS solution can help you to improve overall business productivity, better manage customer expectations, reduce costs, and exceed your customer service agreements.   Another advantage is it can also contribute an essential tool for planning further growth for your business.   7. Improve cost and budgeting control   As has been alluded to earlier, a TMS solution—like Quire—can help to improve how you spend on your projects. Indeed, by being able to monitor tasks, and in what time they’re completed, it will provide a better understanding of where the budget needs to be spent.   Also, team management software will ensure you can monitor how much you actually spent against how much you planned to spend.   The advantage here is you’re able to get a more accurate look at the overview of your current budget. And gain financial projections for the future in real time.   8. Reduce project failures and minimize project risk   The days of trying to keep tabs on everything with spreadsheets and email folders are gone. Now, there’s less chance of tasks going missing or being completely forgotten.   There’s also less risk that key parts of a project will be left undone. Or that no one will know who&#39;s responsible for which tasks. And deadlines. Deadlines are easier to track.   What this all amounts to is a significant reduction in both project risk and failure.

        "title": "Top 8 Productivity Myths that You Should Avoid to Become a Great Leader",
        "excerpt": "   When you’re in charge it’s easy to confuse being busy with being productive. And, it’s easy to fall into that trap of thinking you have to do everything: make every important decision, do 12 things at once. Never stop.   But when does being busy stop being productive? That is, does being constantly busy automatically mean you’re being productive?   The short answer is no, busy does not always equal productive.   However, there is that toxic workplace mindset which would have us believe differently. That mindset which says you must always be doing something. Because if you’re busy, work is being done.   But the obvious caveat should be that the something you’re doing, is something productive. Something purposeful. You’re working on content to bring your client value. Or, you’re working on something that will help internally.   Read more on top 3 productivity tips when using an online to-do list.           The top 8 productivity myths, and what to do instead   We can look busy without being productive. We can think we’re doing all this great work, when really, we’re creating more work for others—or ourselves—later.   It’s easy to fall into the trap of busy equals productivity. Here are 8 productivity myths you easily identify, and what to do instead:   Myth 1: multi-tasking boosts efficiency   Typically, the only thing multitasking boosts is how many errors we make. When trying to do many things at once, we often barely scratch the surface of each task. Instead of giving our full attention, and so completing a task faster, we believe it’s better to do three things at once.   Is that screen loading? Quickly work on something else. Oh, and there’s that email to answer, that call to make, and so on, and so on.   Managing dozens of projects at the same time is a stressful process. One that, ironically, slows down the progress of each task in your workflow.   What to do instead of multi-tasking   The best, and most productive, thing to do is one task at a time. Sounds simple enough, doesn’t it?   Just concentrate and prioritize what’s most important, and work through that. In working this way, you will get through tasks not just quickly but also efficiently. And as you complete each task, you will have a greater sense of accomplishment as you tick them off your list.          Myth 2: procrastination is natural   Procrastinating is usually a sign that there’s something amiss. Maybe you’re lacking direction, or you&#39;re worried about failing, or there’s some lingering doubt as to your current task’s usefulness.   So, instead of finishing the task, you find an excuse to do something else. Procrastination can often be why we multitask. We think if we dip into a few different projects this will help us stay motivated. With the added bonus of getting at least a few things down.   But, as we’ve already mentioned, this backfires more often than not.   What to do when you notice you’re procrastinating   The first thing to do is identify why you’re procrastinating. If it’s a lack of direction, stop and take a quick look at an overview of your project. If your project is mapped out in task management software, this can be done quite easily. You can see the whole project, who’s working on what, and how the whole thing comes together.   Myth 3: complete the busy work first   The busy work, the menial tasks that are always going to be there no matter how many of them you do. These can be left until later. And ideally, should be. Studies have shown that the small, fiddly tasks that can chew up an entire morning, are as harmful to your productivity as scrolling through your social media feeds.   What to do in the morning before the busy work   For the sake of productivity, and meeting deadlines, it is far more valuable to do the hard work first thing. The benefit of this is you’ll be at your most creative, and awake. Putting you in a better position to finish those harder, more meaningful tasks.   When you do need a break from those tasks, that is a good time to do the smaller, lower-priority tasks.   Read more on live a stress-free life with GTD Method.    Myth 4: Leaders thrive under pressure   Pressure may force you to act faster, but that’s not always a good thing. Especially, if you act on impulse, or you don’t consult with the right people. And even if you don’t think you need to consult with someone, it’s never a bad idea to bounce ideas off of others.   Working in a constant state of crisis is not only unhealthy, it tends to make you less creative, and less likely to do meaningful work.   What to do instead of operating in a constant state of pressure   Having a project planned out as much as possible is often one way of avoiding pressure. With everything carefully mapped out, and each staff member’s task list organized to ensure a project is completed on time, there’s less pressure on the leader.   With task management software, this can be done efficiently, reliably, and predictably. Map out projects, and create tasks lists and sublists to ensure team members complete tasks in the right order—and to deadlines. The advantage of this is that there’s less need for day to day management of your team members’ tasks lists. Freeing up your time to do other meaningful work.          Myth 5: write out a to-do list   To-do lists can be productive, but only if you approach them properly. Studies have shown that those who set deadlines with strict parameters are most productive. And those who either don’t set deadlines, or give themselves too much time, fare poorly.   What to do when creating a to-do list   The ideal to-do list is one that ensures every task is working towards the completion of a project. As mentioned in myth 4, the simplest, most reliable way of doing this is with task management software.   It gives you a bird’s eye view of the project’s tasks and deadlines. It also allows you to drill down and see the larger and small tasks lists, and their deadlines.   Creating a to-do list with task management software ensures all tasks are completed in the right order, and to the deadline.          Myth 6: practice makes perfect   Like to-do lists, there’s a right way to do this, and a wrong way. As one analogy puts it, endlessly shooting hoops is not as useful as working on mastering one specific shot. Or, as Bruce Lee put it: I don’t fear the man who practices 10,000 kicks once, I fear the man who practices one kick 10,000 times.   It’s important to re-examine what you’re doing each day. Is each task completed and the meeting attended helping you do your job better?   Everything you do should be helping you move towards becoming a better leader. Which means ascertaining what is the best use of your time, and what areas of your job you can improve upon.   What to do instead of trying to do everything   Instead of endlessly shooting hoops in the hope of perfecting a shot. Figure out which shot you want to perfect, and work towards that. Delegate what can be delegated to free up your time to improve upon those tasks and meetings.   Myth 7: it’s best to power through   It’s a commonly accepted myth that the best thing to do is power on through until a task is completed. That is, if you’re going to start you shouldn’t stop until it’s finished. But, of course, the problem with this is the average person’s brain isn’t designed for this. By powering through our concentration often flags, and we can make mistakes. This slows the process down because more time is needed for quality control.   What to do instead of powering through   Instead of powering through, it is better to work for 90-minute intervals and then have a short break. By doing this, you can potentially increase your productivity by 16%.   A short break can be anything from taking a short walk around your office, to stepping out of the office for some fresh air. Anything that gets you away from your computer can help you feel refreshed and jumpstart your brain.          Myth 8: there’s too much work to do   As was said at the top of the blog, busy doesn’t always mean productive. And not all tasks are equally important. When things get hectic, and there’s a lot to do, it can be easy to get overwhelmed.   If you’re trying to do too much, or you don’t have the proper organizational tools, becoming overwhelmed is quite easy.   What to do when it feels like there’s too much   Organization is the best way to manage your time, and the time of your team. Because when you’re organized, and you know where the goal posts are it’s much simpler to stay on track.   Organizing projects can be done simply, reliably and efficiently with task management software. This will help you keep the project on track and to the deadline   Having a project broken down into tasks, lets you know what needs to be completed and by when. Which can help to keep you, and your team, productive without feeling overwhelmed.   Become a great leader by being more productive   If you are looking to become a great leader, or simply want to improve the efficiencies of your company to complete more projects on time, you need task management software.

        "title": "How to Increase Team Productivity Based on Myers-Briggs Personality Types",
        "excerpt": "   Understanding your team’s different personalities and how this affects their approach to work and their output can help dramatically increase overall productivity. You can learn a lot about someone’s true character in the way they act, and react, to situations with others.   Indeed, how your staff interact with each other can either improve or hamper productivity. To prevent misunderstandings, conflicts, and the workflow from damming up, a manager needs to understand the different ways team members’ personalities affect their daily work interactions.   The completion of projects relies heavily on teamwork. If teams are unable to work together, projects fall apart, and clients don’t get the work they are paying for.   By understanding the personality type of individual team members, it can be easier to effectively manage productivity, general task workflow, and project completion.   The role of the personality types in teamwork   One of the easiest, and most successful ways of understanding individual team member’s personalities is using the Myers Briggs test (MBTI test). This can measure the kind of person your team are. The advantage of this is in better understanding your staff, you will be able to get the most productivity out of them.   The test is not about aptitude, but rather about personal preference. That is, about a person’s tendencies, what scenarios they work better in, and in which situations they’re more likely to thrive in.   The preferences are between a series of two opposing traits:            1. Introverted vs Extroverted   Introversion and extraversion are often referred to as attitudes that depict how a person’s cognitive functions operate. One exists, and thrives, in a world of places, things, and people. And the other is more focused on internal reflections, ideas, and thoughts.   Introverts are more thought-orientated. A lot of thought has to go into something before they take action. Whereas extroverts are much more active. Their momentum is maintained sole by their energy.   Introverts tend to create deeper knowledge, while extroverts are after more knowledge. And finally, introverts tend to recharge in the comfort of their solitude. Extroverts gain their energy by being around others.   2. Sensing vs Intuition   Intuition and sensation are two functions, and they reflect the way a person gathers information. Those who are more on the sensing side of this dichotomy, want to see tangible evidence. They want to be able to smell, taste, feel, see, or hear something for it to be valid.   The intuitive ones prefer their instincts, feelings, or hunches. They use their intuition to connect information, using concepts and ideas to explain others without being too hung up on physical evidence.   3. Thinking vs Feeling   These are the judging functions: feeling against thinking, and they represent how a person makes their decisions. A feeling person goes with their gut instinct. A thinking person will consider their options more rationally before making a decision.   The feeling person will prefer to make decisions based on their emotions. Typically, empathy is the biggest factor in their decision making, along with considering others’ needs.   The thinker employs logic and reason, detaching from their emotions, before coming to a decision.   4. Perception vs Judging   This is not an attitude nor is it a function like the last two. This last pair is about a person’s lifestyle preferences. This last pair only really works when combined with the above three pairs.   For example: A Feeling/Judging person will be empathetic; a Thinking/Judging person looks at life through a logical perspective.   Someone who’s perception is their dominant preference will mostly likely either be an Intuition/Perception person or a Sensing/Perception person.   By understanding the differing personality types, you can better organize and manage a team. Check this link for a comprehensive list of the 16 personality types. The Myers Brigg test doesn’t just determine who is outgoing and who is shy. It also assesses how individuals get their energy (do they need people or solitude to energize).   So, how do you use personality types to help increase productivity?   3 ways to use personality types to help increase productivity   Categorizing team members as simple extroverted or introverted is unhelpfully reductive. It is much more productive to use information on how different personality types work to ensure managers can get the most out of their teams.   The changes don’t have to be big either. Small changes to aspects like the workweek and office environment can help to improve focus for varying personality types.   Three ways to help your team members be more productive:   1. Reduce noise pollution   If your staff are in an office, it’s ideal to have work spaces where people who prefer quitter work spaces can thrive. This can be achieved with noise cancelling headphones, and areas where people looking for a little quiet can excuse themselves.   By creating these quieter spaces, or providing noise cancelling headphones it also helps the people who need noise. Relocating people who need quite allows those who thrive off noise and a little audible chaos to be comfortable in their ideal environment.   2. Offer remote and flexible working options   This has become easier as more and more companies have been forced to allow their staff to work from home. However, remote and flexible working options still have their challenges and obstacles.   In a pre-COVID survey, it was determined that 67% of workers would be more productive if they could work from home. Of course, for this to work, managers must be able to manage and monitor tasks and project workflow.   In the same survey, 61% said they’d be able to get more work done if they had more flexible work hours. Again, this requires managers and HR departments to have the right processes in place. This ensures that the projects are completed on time with minimal disruptions even if different departments work at different times.   3. Restructure breaks   Some productivity experts actually encourage people to take as many as 7 breaks each day for maximum productivity. However, anyone who’s ever worked in an office knows that is simply not practical. Finding time to take a lunch break is difficult enough.   The one thing all experts do agree on is that no matter what your personality type, a break away from work is important. Whether you are more introverted/quiet and just need to get away from the office and recharge somewhere, or you need to go and socialise with friends for your break.   Either way, it’s necessary to literally and figuratively walk away from work to recharge. Doing this can have a significant positive impact on your daily productivity.

How task management software can help improve productivity   Task management software can help managers work with different personality types to help ensure they are working at their most productive. For some personality types who need a little direction, like the advocate and the mediator, task management software helps provide that direction.   Feel in control and have a sense of direction   It does this by providing a visual collaborative platform that shows team members the project. Specifically, which tasks need to be done, and in what order.   This makes task workflow a visual process so that everything can be arranged and prioritized for those who like a sense of order in their work day. As well for those who like knowing the reason they’re doing task X is because task Y can’t be done until X is complete.   Easier communication   Task software management also makes it easy to communicate with your team members. And for those who get anxiety at the thought of phone calls, you can leave comments in the tasks and other people will get notified in real time.   There is also the option to message people through the task management software.   Work remotely or flexibly without fuss   Want or need to work remotely? Need to work flexible hours due to other commitments or health issues? Working remotely has become a reality for many businesses lately. With the right task management software, all you need is an internet connection, laptop, and your logins and you can work from anywhere, anytime.   Task management software allows creatives to focus their effort and energy doing what they’re best at. And the management of tasks, ensuring work is completed on time and in the right order is taken care of for them.   You can do teamwork in real time, no matter where you are. Sharing and delegating tasks to colleagues, and you can see their modifications on your screen straight away.          Productivity tips for different personality types   From ensuring staff take at least one meaningful break during the day, to providing an ideal work environment, there are quite a few things you can do to improve productivity for your team.   Improving your team’s ability to collaborate, whether they are in office or at home, goes a long way to increasing productivity.   Quire’s task management software has helped hundreds of organizations dramatically increase teamwork productivity, workflow, and project management completion. Whether your business is entirely remote, in-office or a combination of the two, our software can provide the solution for seamless task management.   This will help to ensure teamwork is carried out smoothly and efficiently. And, has the added advantage of being recorded into the software for future reference.   That&#39;s all for today!

        "title": "How to Win as a Remote Team and Productivity Advice from Quire Community Manager",
        "excerpt": "   Quire is a modern collaborative project management software that helps thousands of dynamic teams achieve big milestones together. With the mission of connecting people and bringing success to businesses, Quire team spends a lot of time listening to users’ stories and learning more about how different teams use different methods to get things done.    Today we are going to sit down and talk with our Community Manager - the person who builds the bridge that connects Quire team and our users - Peggy, to understand more about how she uses Quire to navigate her work and communicate with Quire community.   1. What was your journey to becoming a Community Manager?   Back in college, I was studying Translation and Interpreting so naturally, I am drawn to the jobs that help to connect people. For a couple of years spending in a garment company as a purchaser, I decided to challenge myself with a more dynamic industry so I joined Quire as a Community Manager. I immediately felt in love with the tech world. It’s truly fascinating to see how a software is developed from scratch, not to mention being a part of the developing  process.    Regularly as you are using a software, you would wonder how each feature was crafted and why exactly the developers know what users expect. Being a Community Manager lets me live in the both worlds, from developers’ end to users’ end. I listen to users’ stories shared in the Quire Feedbacks forum, via email communications or interviews so that we can learn more about how Quire can help users achieve their goals.    Being able to communicate with users directly and listen to their success stories with Quire inspire me a lot as a Community Manager. A lot of users have provided us with incredible insights and invaluable feedback on how we can improve Quire to better meet users’ needs to optimize their workflows. Sometimes, we also get to know which features users are having difficulties with.    As a Community Manager, I also lead the localization process for all of the 9 languages with 8 translators for Quire. My day-to-day work involves a lot of team communication and task management so Quire has been a great assistant from day one!   2. Tell us what a day is like in Quire community team?   My day usually starts with a cup of coffee on my desk! 😁  After the caffeine kicks in, I will read through all the feedback in Quire Forum, go through every users’ emails and from other channels such as Facebook, Youtube, Quire blog, Twitter, and Instagram. Social media is a great way to reach out and  build relationships with our users so my team and I spend a lot of time going through users’ comments or tweets so that we can make sure we leave no one’s suggestions behind.    Every feedback and suggestion from Quire users will be listed as a task in our internal Quire project. Then I will categorize all of the tasks based on the severity of the issues and the priority level. Sometimes I use different sublists to better organize the tasks. For example, I will create a sublist that contains all of the tasks that are relevant for different teams and use the sublist as my personal view to keep track of what I care for.      Some days are great and breezy, while some other days need more than one cup of coffee. Those are the days when we experience quite a few glitches reported by our users. We need to immediately categorize the bugs and inform the Dev team. For every issue fixed, a task is completed in our collaborative project in Quire. Our Community team categorizes all of the bugs and feedback using one collaborative Kanban Board. Each column in the Kanban Board has a meaningful status or definition. For some critical issues that require immediate attention, we would create a board to track the progress  our Dev Team has made to solve the issue so that we can inform our users on time.     &quot;Some days seem a bit challenging, but at the end of the day, it’s all about building connections between the Quire team and our users and fostering engagement among Quire community members.&quot;    3. How about the localization team and what is so unique about Quire translators?   As a translator and interpreter myself,  I’m always inspired by languages and exotic cultures. Last year, we managed to onboard 5 more translators to join the Quire localization team. The most incredible thing is, all of them are located in different countries and even before the unfortunate coronavirus situation, we all work together remotely using 9 different Quire projects.    We have never met in person, but we feel so close. Every translator works with me directly in their own Quire organization. We automate the localization process using Quire tasks and our daily communication is made through every comment in Quire and Skype calls.   When our Product team adds a new feature to Quire, there will be a lot of updates and newly added messages. Each of the new messages in Quire will be added to Quire as a new task and the translators will get notified about their new work. Since most of our translators do not have tech background or nor they are too familiar with SaaS platform, we will attach screenshots and embed as many UI photos to the description section to help our translators have a better understanding of the messages that need to be translated.    When the translators finish translating the message, they will complete the task and I will receive the notification. There’s no need to bombard our translators with reminder messages or aggressive notes. Case is closed when a task is completed!       Since our localization team is not a small scale team, it’s quite challenging to keep up with all of the existing projects. I use Smart Folder to create a bird’s-eye view to see all of the tasks from every translator. I am a heavy user of customized filters to create my own view to track the task lists.    Sometimes I kick off my day with My Tasks! I can view all of the tasks that are assigned to me,  most of them are from the Community team and the Localization team! Whenever Quire translators have difficulty understanding the context of a message, they will assign the task to me and I will double check.    I am a firm believer that a better workflow creates better productivity, so I spend so much time on trying to figure out what the best way to communicate and collaborate with our remote localization team is. We adjust so many things as we continue working with a new translator. There’s no perfect workflow, we just try to find the flow that rhymes best with our team.    4. What does Quire’s mission mean to you?   Everyday I receive many suggestions and feedback from Quire users, all of them are very interesting and inspirational. Every user is a learning opportunity and a learning curve at the same time. Having the chance to interact and communicate with our users is the most rewarding part of my job. I&#39;ve learned a lot from our users every day through their feedback and suggestions, both professionally and personally.    Every big dream needs a starting point. I would want to help each and every Quire user to achieve their missions and their goals. Start your dream with Quire. Don&#39;t hesitate to share your stories with us! We’re here to walk your dreams home!   Read more about how Quire is developed from a serial entrepreneur's viewpoint.    5. What is your mantra when it comes to productivity?   &quot;It&#39;s okay to grow slow. Consistency is the key.&quot; Joining a tech company has taught me a lot about how everyday processes mean so much more than an end result. You need to break down your big goal into digestible small tasks so that you can start to work on your dream somewhere.     Software development is a continuous process, rather than a done-and-be-over-with. We understand that each of you is eager to see new updates or features on Quire. However, Quire is built with the philosophy of not becoming another all-in-one solution. We go through every feedback at our product meeting and discuss actively about how to add a new function or feature to Quire that doesn&#39;t break the existing workflow and still provide new values to users&#39; workflow.     Quire grows together with our users. We have achieved so much as a team, and all of this is possible because of our community. There are endless opportunities to explore for Quire, and we can’t wait to achieve the next milestone with Quire community!  ",

        "title": "How to Boost Teamwork Performance with Transparent Communication",
        "excerpt": "   Transparency has a couple of different meanings. One is the literal sense of being transparent, another is, “the quality of being done in an open way without secrets.”   In terms of task management, it means having a system that allows all team members relevant access to necessary information. And done in a way that is efficient and easy.   There are those project managers who believe that transparency can actually be harmful and even risky to a project’s success. However, transparency in a project has benefits that will always outweigh any potential risks.   Different kinds of teams also have their own issues to tackle when it comes to transparency. For example, the way a remote team communicates differs from how an in-the-office team will communicate. And this is often reflected in how productive a team is.   In this article we’re going to look at how to improve team communication transparency whether you’re working remotely or in the office. And how this benefits team productivity in a remote work culture.   Team communication transparency   As mentioned, there are those project managers who feel that transparency poses risks to the success of a project. The problem with this is that leaving employees in the dark about important information often leads to tasks being done incorrectly.   Which isn’t intentional on the employees’ part. After all they can only work with what they’ve got. This is why transparency in team communication is vital. The advantages of transparency are many, but we’ve selected three to illustrate the point.          3 reasons why transparency in team communication is vital   1. Create Trust and teamwork   Being transparent in a team is about building openness, trust, and honesty. Transparency can make a team work better as a cohesive unit. Teams working together on a project tend to trust each other more when they are encouraged to know, and understand, what the whole team is doing. This also engenders a more collaborative nature which goes a long way to helping a team succeed at their individual tasks as well as completing the project on time.   2. Ensure work stays on track   When each team member knows what is expected of them, and of each other, it helps to prevent delays. Missed milestones and delays can either disrupt or kill a project. That is why transparency in team communication is necessary to ensure there are bottlenecks. And to ensure situations can be resolved before they become problems.   3. Improve a team’s productivity   Access to all the necessary information about a project has been shown to improve productivity. Having access to key information allows team members to keep working, rather than waiting for a project manager to feed them tasks piecemeal. Which is a slow, tedious, and often unnecessary way of managing tasks. Additionally, having access to all the necessary information makes working collaboratively with other members on a project much easier.   Read more on how to improve productivity with Deep Work method.   The difference between transparency in remote teamwork communication and face-to-face teamwork communication   But transparency does look different depending on how your teams operate. Remote teamwork communication is, by necessity, different to face-to-face teamwork communication.   Many have argued that working in an office is the most productive way. While others—especially employees—argue that home has fewer distractions than the office, making it more productive.   In truth, it’s not a question of which environment has few distractions, or more. It’s a question of communication and transparency. Conventional wisdom states that being in an office is more productive, because it’s quicker and easy to have a conversation, make a decision, and get back to work.   But this conventional wisdom pre-dates task management software, and an ever-evolving work environment. Which isn’t to say that working from home is more productive. What it is saying is how you manage your projects, their associated tasks, and your team member’s time is what determines the quality of productivity.   Remote teamwork communication vs in-office teamwork communication   The difference between remote teamwork and in-office teamwork communication can be boiled down to four key areas. These include how meetings are held, where decisions are made, how productivity is measured, and project management.   Meetings: In an office environment, meetings occur exclusively in-office and are seldom recorded. Whereas in a remote teamwork situation, meetings are kept brief, productive, and are recorded for future reference.   Decision making: In a remote teamwork situation, decisions are made online during operating hours. These too are kept on record for future reference. Too frequently key decisions are made around a water cooler or at drinks after work. When this does happen, there’s no record of the conversation, and only hearsay can be passed to team members later on.   Measuring productivity: For in-office employees, being in the office, sitting at their desk was associated with being meaningful or busy work. Remote staff’s productivity is measured rather simply by how much work they achieve rather than the others they spend achieving it.   Project management: In-office project managers are expected to be in the office all the time. For a remote team’s project manager, they are able to work from anywhere with an internet connection. With the right project management software, it’s not where the project manager works, but how well they communicate.   Whether your team is predominantly in-office or remote, transparency can be improved with task management software. And in improving transparency, you are improving the productivity of your team.          5 ways task management software can boost productivity   Transparency is known to improve productivity. The right task management software can boost productivity by improving trust, increasing communication, ensuring greater accountability, customizing permissions, and improving client interactions.   1.  Improved trust   Be wary of anyone who tells you trust isn’t an important part of teamwork. High levels of trust are important because it creates:    The confidence to admit if mistakes are made, and correct them. A culture of authenticity and joy. A willingness to help others succeed in their tasks. The tenacity to keep working, even if there are setbacks. The ability to accept tough feedback, as well the confidence to provide it.   But, of course, trust is not an easy thing to build. To do so requires repeated personal, helpful, and productive interactions. And these interactions can really only take place in an environment that is transparent. And it doesn’t matter if the environment is in-office or digital.   2.  Increased communication   Strong communication is the most effective way to promote transparency. Concise, clear, and considerate communication enables collaboration by making the process easier for team members to discuss issues and ideas.   Using a top-grade project management software (like Quire), it provides team members with several communication channels. Project management software allows team members to tag specific people, send instant messages, and leave comments for all to see.   With a cloud-based storage, the software is able to retain all notes so that people can look at them if necessary.   3.  Greater accountability   It’s expected of team members in transparent environments that will hold each other accountable. The right project management software will include features that make accountability possible.   In a project platform, it can be helpful to see each person’s task list, to see which specific tasks they’ve been assigned. So, no one’s unsure who’s responsible for which tasks, and their due dates.   4.  Customized permissions   Transparency doesn’t have to be total for it to be effective. After all, there are some confidential aspects and information of a contract or project that may need to remain confidential. Quire’s task management software makes it possible to provide team members with different permission levels.   This way teams can still do the work they need to do collaboratively, but not all team members need access to billing information. Permissions can be applied to everything from tasks and messages to entire projects. And these permissions are not set in stone—it’s not difficult for permissions to be changed as needed.   5.  Better client interactions   Project management software is able to create reports to track metrics. The sort of metrics that clients want to know about like billable hours.   Customizable dashboards allow project managers to create several dashboards. For example: you can have a dashboard for internal task management, and another that has a breakdown of numbers and other data necessary for client calls.   By being transparent with clients, they are often happier for being informed.          How a task management software like Quire can help with transparency in team communication   If you are looking to create more transparency, build trust, and generally improve your team’s productivity and efficiencies, task management software is the answer you’re looking for.   Quire’s project management software is one of the best ways to organize your projects, communicate effectively, and collaborate effectively online, and in real time.   That’s all for today!

        "title": "How a Task Management Software Helps Businesses Achieve Higher Productivity in a Post-pandemic World",
        "excerpt": "   Before the pandemic, roughly 30% of the part-time workforce was working remotely. It is estimated this will expand to at least 48% post-pandemic. Until the pandemic is over, it’s unclear exactly how much of the full-time workforce that can work remotely, will continue to do so.   However, the reality for managers is that they are facing a greater need to prioritize cloud-based systems for:    collaboration tools. employee evaluations. performance management.   It also means employees may find themselves in more important strategic roles than they were pre-pandemic. Which is due to the rise in the need for structured autonomy as a result of remote working (source).   These reasons are why task management software has become even more important than it already was. With task management software you can:    plan ahead and break down ideas into actionable tasks track project status outsource work to an external team. setup specific roles and permissions. share and delegate teamwork in real time. setup recurring tasks and reminders   How task management software improves productivity   With data from May 2020, it looks like the at-home workforce is not only here to stay, but here to change how many businesses approach their day-to-day management and implementation of tasks.   While many businesses will attempt to return to office work, the number of outsourcing and work-from-home staff won’t return completely to pre-pandemic numbers.   The gig economy and the rise of outsourcing   With the rise of the gig economy, more and more businesses are hiring freelancers who offer project-based work, or who will work on a retainer. With there being no sign of this slowing down, it’s become important for project managers to be able to quickly and efficiently keep tabs on all aspects of the projects in their portfolio.    Industries such as digital marketing, finance, product management, event management, IT, and manufacturing are the ones which need task management software the most. As these are the industries which currently rely heavily on task-orientated projects for their venue. And outside of retail, hospitality, and tourism are some of the hardest hit by the pandemic.   Many of these industries have already had to adjust to an at-home work force to navigate through the pandemic. However, in many cases it’s been a ‘by the seat of your pants’ operation, which is hardly sustainable. Task management software has a range of benefits to sustainably improve productivity now and into the post-pandemic future.          How task management software can help your business be more productive   Here are four ways task management software can help your staff be more productive, and so improve your profits:    1. Easier task prioritization   Prioritizing tasks is an important part of being able to meet deadlines. When a team doesn’t know which tasks need to be done first, it becomes difficult to manage them on time. Essentially, when staff start work, they can get stuck on low priority tasks which drain time away from important tasks.   With task management software you can overcome any prioritization problems or issues by establishing lists and sublists to ensure the right tasks are being focused on. This streamlines staff time and ensures work is done in a timely fashion.   2. Keep track across all tasks   Manually tracking tasks burns a lot of time for management staff, especially where they have to check their team’s work individually if there’s a problem. With a task management software, you can view all the tasks on any given project on one screen.   You can see the whole project, and quickly check notes and comments of every staff member to identify what is going on, and where the tasks and projects are at.   3. Central hub to manage everything from   Whether you’re working on a single project or many projects, it’s necessary to maintain everything essential about the project close to hand. With task management software, you can keep everything together from notes and calendars, to tickets and cards, and much more.   With the right management software, you can save all activities your team performs while working so they won’t have to memorize things. It also makes it simpler for the whole team to stay on track and on top of their tasks.   If you want to avoid losing any sensitive information, important tasks or deadlines, tasks management apps can help you. Software like Quire, will not only help you save time, it will also help to digitize your whole process making your data more accessible, easy to track and easy to manage.   4. Productivity booster   To boost productivity is simple: spend more time working on tasks, and less time finding the tasks to work on. Sounds simple right? But too often in organizations, a project is not planned out correctly and teams are expected to figure out what, how, and by when they are supposed to complete tasks.   This is really the job of a project manager. And while it is necessary for a project meeting to happen prior to the commencement of work, there should be a clear direction for each team—if not for each team member.   To avoid staff spending a lot of time finding tasks, and there being no real guarantee they find the most important task, management software can help. With project lists and sublists, as well as an easy search function, staff can find their tasks quickly. They can also decide which tasks are the priorities, and which ones can be left until the end.   All the staff have to do now is plan out their time to ensure they complete the tasks, and then start work.   Read more on how to improve time management skills for project managers.   Why is this especially important for remote workers?   For staff working remotely, clear direction is vital to their success, and the success of any given project being worked on. Communication is an important part of successfully managing a team and completing a project. This becomes emphasized when the team is no longer in the same office as you.   Instead of having video conference calls, or phone calls every 5 minutes with different staff checking up on them, a centralized hub where you can check all projects, and all team member’s tasks just makes sense.   It means the project manager isn’t spending their days doing nothing but auditing and cross-checking. They can do the whole thing quickly and painlessly, allowing them to work on new projects, liaise with clients, or any other sort of work which can help bottom-line revenue.   Remote workers will feel more effective working in a centralized hub, where they can quickly communicate with team members and project managers. It also makes them more accountable, and easier to track just how much work they’re getting down and how quickly it’s being done.   At the end of the day, this is why businesses want task management software: it is an efficient and cost-effective way of improving productivity and increasing your revenue by ensuring all projects are completed to the letter and on time.          Online businesses in the post-pandemic world   Businesses that did not want staff to work remotely because of either trust issues or infrastructure issues, have had to make some hard choices. For some, it was implementing the necessary infrastructure to be able to work from home. For other business owners, it was taking a hard look at their staff and deciding whether to trust them and keep making money, or shut the business down until they could operate as normal.   Every online business that could have its staff work remotely did. Because otherwise it would have spelt financial ruin for them. So, they had to trust staff, and they had to implement infrastructure to support a remote team.   Now, with over three months of data at analysts’ disposal, it looks like the number of people working from home will only decrease slightly in the post-pandemic world. This is for a number of reasons: but the key ones seem to be that many employees have stated they feel happier and more productive at home.   Because of the way work has to be tracked with remote workers, managers can more easily see who’s doing what, and how long they are doing it for.   The advantages of cloud-based services to online businesses   When we get to the post-pandemic world, online businesses will see that with a task management system, and other cloud-based services are cheaper to operate, easier to scale, easier to manage, and better for productivity and profitability.

        "title": "A Guide to Deep Work: How to Achieve the Ultimate Productivity",
        "excerpt": "   If you are looking for a way to become more effective, more productive and just better at everything you do, deep work is the productivity mindset you need.   Deep work is not some marketing gimmick designed to sell books and speaking gigs. Rather, deep work is a way to approach your professional life in such a way that generates the best results consistently.   This is not a case of: work smarter, not harder. This is a case of: work smarter and harder to produce a superior result in a consistent and sustainable way. Cal Newport, who coined the phrase deep work described it as a method that “will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship.”   The difference between shallow work and deep work   Deep work is “the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task,” this is different to shallow work which are “tasks that almost anyone, with a minimum of training, could accomplish.”   For example, shallow work is answering emails, responding to messages, or attending meetings. This stuff is easy to do, and it makes us feel as though we’re being productive. Shallow work also typically involves a lot of interaction with other people, which also makes it attractive.   The sense of accomplishment derived from shallow work makes it appealing. However, deep work is what provides most value. And not only value in terms of output, but also an increase in the quality of valuable output.   When you start to engage in deep work, you will feel a greater sense of achievement in the work you’re doing.          6 steps to achieve the ultimate productivity with deep work   So, how do you engage in deep work? To make the most of deep work you need to turn it into a habit. It must be a part of every work day in order for it to be of any use to you. Here are six steps to help you effectively start using deep work:   1. Prepare your week and clarify your goals   Preparing your week in advance, or if your weeks chop and change too much, prepare the next day. This allows you to start each day with a bit of clarity.   Preparing your day or week can start with goal setting. What is the end-goal of the next day’s work? What should it achieve? From there you can work backwards to determine what you need to do to achieve that goal. Break that down into chunks that you can do throughout the day that will achieve your daily goals.   The clarity this preparation provides will help you to concentrate more specifically on the task at hand.   2. Automate what can be automated   Mapping out your daily to-do list, setting goals and delegating shallow work should not be a time-consuming task. You should, ideally, be able to do it in an efficient and easy-to-manage way.   With the right project management and centralized collaboration tool, it’s quite easy to create your own to-do list as well as ensure other tasks that can be done by another staff member are delegated.   This frees up your time to focus on what’s important. With the help of a project management tool like Quire, you can keep on top of your own tasks in order of priority while also checking (at the end of the day) that others have completed their work.   3. Focus on one task at a time   Deep work is about concentrating on one task at a time. By giving all your attention and all your focus to only one thing for an extended period of time, it allows your brain to better process what’s in front of it.   Focus on this task for 40 minutes or an hour or two, and you’ll find you are able to accomplish a lot. And quickly.   The next step is then to rest. At the end of a deep work session, don’t immediately try to jump into the next task.   Resting will allow your brain to wind down and leave the last task. After a rest you can approach a new task with a fresh perspective: allowing you to devote all of your attention to that singular goal.          4. Create a ritual   To get the most out of a deep work session, you need to build a ritual; a routine. You need to turn deep work into a daily habit. When you prepare your day, part of that preparation will involve chunks of time devoted to deep work.   This may be in hour or two-hour chunks during a day, but it is important that you stick to these times. Remove all distractions, disconnect from the world, and work on your allotted deep work tasks.   Your ritual must include (along with an allotted time):    A specific place for you to work: somewhere free of distractions. A plan of attack. How do you plan to eliminate all distractions for this allotted time to sustain the deep work mentality? Sustenance. From something as simple as starting with a cup of coffee, to having the right kind of energy-providing snacks on hand to help keep you focused.   Creating a ritual takes time and practice. Creating a space where you can work uninterrupted and at maximum efficiency may take some time to work out. But once you have, start slowly. Your first deep work session may be only 20 minutes. And you might do that 3 times a day.   Then you’ll move up to 30 minutes, then 40, then eventually to an hour. Professionals who have been doing deep work for a while can maintain the deep work focus for as long as four hours.   But it takes time, and practice and patience.   5. Shut down social media   For deep work to be effective you must remove all distractions. Deep work is about putting all your focus, energy and attention into one place. Social media will drag part of your brain one way while another part of your brain tries to focus on the task at hand.   You don’t need cat videos on your mind while you’re trying to create high-quality value.   As part of your schedule, allocate small blocks of time where you can briefly check social media, emails and messages. But stick to these brief blocks of time. While you’re at work, you need to focus on what matters most: doing your job well.   6. Switch off for the day   When you’re done for the day. Be done. Don’t try to eke out an extra hour or two after dinner in the hopes of getting more done. After the strain of your day (and if you haven’t strained your brain during a deep work session, you haven’t done a deep work session), you need to let your brain relax and recharge. However, that doesn’t necessarily always mean watching terrible TV or TikTok videos. Disconnect from work and do something that’s relaxing but not (necessarily) mind numbing.   Read more on how to take a break when working remotely to increase productivity.   How to achieve the ultimate productivity   Deep work is a method of approaching cognitively demanding tasks free from distractions. It’s about ignoring the shallow work long enough to ensure you’re creating high-quality value that no one else could.   To help you focus, you want to be able to easily create to-do lists, streamline task delegation and have all this in one easy-to-manage, easy-to access place.   Not only will this help you prepare your day and set your goals, it will also allow you to stay away from shallow work until its allotted time in your scheduled day.   The overall effect of a combination of deep work plus a project management and centralized collaboration tool, is increased productivity for yourself and the whole team.

        "title": "How to Take a Break When Working Remotely to Increase Productivity?",
        "excerpt": "   We are living in a workaholic culture that even taking a longer lunch break than usual might stir up worry, stress and anxiety that other colleagues might think less of us. We are obsessed with being “work martyrs” to prove our abilities to meet deadlines and complete the to-do lists every single day.    Business owners might not be happy to see their employees taking a break during work. Breaks can be easily mistaken for “wasting time” for leisure purposes. Who would want to pay their employees for not doing their jobs, right?    But little do you know that taking breaks properly can increase productivity, on many levels. A new study has shown that a brief diversion from a task can drastically improve one’s productivity and ability to focus on the task at hand.   Read more on 7 productivity tips to avoid burnout at work.   The benefits of taking a proper break   1. Avoid physically and mentally burnout          Even if you are a chronic workaholic, you should never push yourself to a breaking point. Long-term productivity always prevails short-term achievements. Being overwhelming can cost you so much more than just a couple days of feeling down or unmotivated. Working for long periods can also put your health at risk. Science has proven that long working hours without interruptions will increase heart failures, diabetes, stress-related disease and brain damage. Your to-do list can wait for another 15-minute break, but your health can’t.   2. Get your mind the right fuel to regain productivity          To keep your brain working at its peak performance, taking a break regularly can release dopamine and decrease cortisol levels to help your brain relax. A lot of employees mistakenly believe having a break equals not doing your job or being lazy. However, if you are constantly working on a project that requires concentration and creativity, your prefrontal cortex where all of the decision making and logical thinking happens is constantly under stress as well. Without a necessary downtime, your brain will get fatigued and you will get stuck at your task list without any progression.    Read more on 6 mistakes project managers make that kill productivity   3. Cultivate a healthier schedule and get rid of addictions          If you keep lighting a cigarette once every 20 minutes, chances are you have been too stressed for a long time. Instead of sticking to your bad habits, taking a longer lunch break to enjoy your healthy meal can make a huge impact on your productivity. Starting from a nutritious meal, you can incorporate more healthy habits into your work life. You can even squeeze in a 25-minute nap, which can reset your working brain for better decision making and prevent memory loss.       How to set up constructive breaks when working remotely?   1. Schedule your breaks   Even if you are currently working from your sofa at the moment, taking a break isn’t something that you should be ashamed of. Many people believe that when you’re not in the office, you’re lazy. However, no matter where you are working from, short breaks can help you recharge your energy and help you break away from the productivity slumps.    If your job is really demanding, try to squeeze 10-minute breaks after every hour of deep work. After working for every one hour, your brain has used up all of the focusing and consolidation quotas, you need to give yourself some downtime to retain the best performance.    2. Create a healthy break routine   When you are working, your brain and your mental state have been pushed to the maximum limitation in order to get jobs done. So during your downtime, if you choose to play video games or some other activities that require intense concentration, it actually does more harm than good to yourself.    Try to indulge yourself with some healthy periodic breaks throughout the day. If possible, take a walk in the nearby park to surround yourself with plants and green spaces. If you’re locked down inside your house, try to go to another room and close your eyes for 5 minutes to relax the muscles and let your brain breathe. You don’t have to keep your break work-related, just find something relaxing to do. Sometimes a good nap can be an incredible way to reboot your brain and provide energy and enthusiasm.   3. Talk to someone during your breaks   Especially when you’re alone working remotely, you should reach out to your colleagues to have a real conversation. If emails or a project management software app isn’t the best way to communicate with your teams, try to call them via Skype or cell phones. It doesn’t mean you have to conduct a meaningful deep conversation with your friends or colleagues during your breaks, a quick catch-up could also help you take your mind off the stress.    Social networking is very important to reinforce bonds and increase collaboration opportunities. Casual conversations between team members can really increase team productivity by 20%. Remote working might prevent you from chatting with your colleagues by the water cooler, however, a virtual coffee break can also do the trick! Pour yourself a cup of cold-brew and call someone to rant about your jobs! After all, you’ve earned your breaks by working hard all day long!    Read more on the art of being productive while staying in.   Work hard, but never forget to balance your life          We are living in a world where being a chronic workaholic makes you appear as hard-working and ambitious. There’s nothing wrong with working hard for what you believe in and creating values for others. However, never forget to take care of yourself too. Having constructive breaks won’t make you a lazy person. There’s a difference between people who burn out and people who burn bright. Productivity doesn’t mean working to death. The era of working hard should be over by now. Productivity now means constantly working smart, creating a healthy balanced lifestyle instead of driving yourself crazy.    That’s all for today!

        "title": "6 Mistakes Project Managers Make that Kill Productivity",
        "excerpt": "   (Photo by Andrea Piacquadio on Pexels)   With so many businesses having had to move to remote working, not all were ready for this big shift. So, we thought we would look at six common mistakes project managers are making in managing remote teams, and how those mistakes can be easily corrected to improve productivity.   The common mistakes of project management that can kill productivity   It’s only useful to point out mistakes if you’re going to provide the solution to the problems. As we look at each mistake, this article is going to focus more on how to solve the mistake than on the mistake itself. Common project management mistakes that kill productivity include:    Not managing people correctly. Not meeting the whole team before work begins on a project. A lack of prioritization and breakdown of projects into manageable tasks.   Also, using a mess of spreadsheets and emails rather than a project tool is a very common mistake that occurs when people are trying to cut corners. Here are some of the most common mistakes that kill productivity and how you can avoid those mistakes altogether.    🔖 Read more on how to work from home and still stay productive   1. Forgetting people management is part of project management          A project has so many moving parts it’s sometimes easy to forget that a project needs people to complete the work.    To get the best work out of people there needs to be clear communication. Which means making sure each team member knows what they’re doing, and how their part affects the whole project.   If you just assume everyone knows their role, you run the risk of:    The project being delayed. The quality of the work not being as good. It costs more than it should.   If your employees are working remotely, clearly communicating their role and how it affects the overall project is vital to complete the project to specifications.    2. Forgetting to set goals with the whole team at the beginning          Following on from the first point: the whole team needs to the know the roles, responsibilities and deliverables of the project from the beginning. Having a project meeting can help define and set the expectations of the project’s outcome.   Not having this meeting takes more time than having it. After all, if you’re a project manager, would you rather explain the project goals once or to each team member individually?   Having this meeting before work begins on a project can help make the team better equipped to be organized and ready to meet the project’s specifications.   It also is a great way for people to ask questions and have issues ironed out before work. Which is far more preferable than finding mistakes or confusion mid-project.   3. Not prioritizing tasks and projects          Without proper management, organization, and prioritization, it can be alarmingly easy for important projects to lie forgotten. Especially, with a remote team.   It’s not an uncommon sight in some companies to see staff with their head down working hard on some low priority project while the higher priority ones languish in a queue.   In this scenario, the staff member may not be aware of the higher priority task. If that has not been communicated to them, a staff member is always going to work on what’s immediately in front of them.   It’s the job of the project manager to ensure all team members are aware of the hierarchy of priorities. As well as when priorities change. It’s not uncommon for a previously low priority task to change in a matter of days into a high priority task.   By clearly communicating project priorities, team members know exactly what they should be working on; how long they have to work on it; and what’s next in the queue for them.    🔖 Read more on 5 tips to improve time management skills for project managers   4. Not using the right management tools          Every point so far has driven one thing home: the need for communication. Not having a management tool for projects in this digital age, is a recipe for disaster.   The right management tool helps keep everyone on track, it shows what tasks have been completed, and what’s left to do and by whom it’s left to do.   The right management tool will make it easier to:    Tackle big projects by breaking them down into easier-to-manage steps. Visualize your workflow so you can better manage and focus on the necessary tasks. Create sublists for individual team members to help them stay focused on the right tasks at the appropriate time. Instant messaging. Share and delegate tasks, and see their modifications instantly. And so much more.   By using the right management tool, you can give everyone on your team the most accurate, up-to-the-minute project information.   5. Not breaking down large projects into manageable pieces          Not breaking down large projects into manageable pieces is a great way to make your team fill overwhelmed, uncomfortable and unsure if they’ll be able to complete the project on time.   The answer is to break down a project into manageable tasks. This enables your team to successfully complete tasks in the right order to better complete the project on time and budget.   When you do break down a project into manageable tasks, the next important step is to ensure each task is handed off to the team member most suited for the task.   6. Forgetting to communicate regularly with team members          We’ll end this list of mistakes where we began: communicating with your team. But it’s not enough to only do it at the start of a project. It’s important, especially with a remote team, to establish regular meetings. Which don’t have to be long.   Five- or ten-minute meetings can help to track things. And these meetings don’t have to be with the whole team. But it is ideal to speak to key members of staff regularly to ensure everything is on track.   This is not micro-managing either. You’re not looking (virtually) over your team’s shoulder, you’re just having a quick check-in to make sure everything’s going to plan.    How can Quire help overcome these mistakes?   If you’re looking for a project management tool that is simple to use and navigate, Quire is the tool you’re looking for. Quire is also designed to be a centralized collaboration tool, to help improve communication, organization and workflow.          That’s all for today! What’s your story of being a project manager?

        "title": "The Art of Being Productive While Staying In",
        "excerpt": "   (Photo by Thought Catalog on Unsplash)   In the last couple months,  you must have been fed up with all of the terms “working at home” or “lockdown” or “social distancing”. There are thousands of posts on social media from Facebook to Instagram to Twitter that show how “staying inside” ruins the international economy, kills productivity and overall bores people to death.    The current situation is dire, no matter where you are right now. Nations announce their plans to lockdown for another month, businesses let employees go on sabbatical leave, economy curve shoots straight downward, etc. Everything you read in the media makes you worry. Invisibly, without notice, we are losing our minds. Staying in appears to be the worst thing that can ever happen to human beings. But, is it the end of the world if you’re forced to stay at home for another week?   What can we do now? What should we do to make staying in less worse? How can we train our minds to cope with the new level of boredom? What should we prepare for our mental health? Today, in this post, as a team that works remotely almost from the first day, we would like to reveal the art of staying in while still keeping sane and getting things done.     🔖 Read more on how to work from home and still stay productive   1. Start a book club with a checklist          We usually make endless excuses to avoid reading: too busy, too tired, not in the mood. But now, you are staying inside and reading should be prioritized. Make a to-do list and write down the books that you are currently reading or you want to read in the future. For each book, write one or two key takeaways. You should commit to read for at least 20-30 pages a day and keep a reading journal to track your reading progress. You will be amazed by how many books you have read when the quarantine period is over.    Here are some of the books that we recommend you to read during this challenging time:     Factfulness: Ten Reasons We&#39;re Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Rönnlund: When we are all facing a pandemic crisis, it is really difficult to just “stay hopeful to see the curve will flatten one day”. This book is devoted to presenting readers with ten instincts (that are all proven with data collection and practical analysis) that keep us from seeing the world factfully. Hans argues that these instincts make it difficult to put events in perspective.  Don’t trust the biased media, don’t divide the world into “us” and “them”, look for the facts and mindfully examine the data. The world is getting better, and so are we.   Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action by Simon Sinek: Everybody knows what they do, some know how they do it, very few people know why they do what they do. The WHY theory gives us the purposes and beliefs behind every action, the ability to make better decisions as entrepreneurs as well as individuals. If you want to sell a product, start with the reason why your potential customers would want to buy your product. The book provides great insights from business, military and social movements where leaders identify their Why and how they breathe the WHY into their organizations.  The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down by Haemin Sunim:  “The world moves fast, but that doesn’t mean we have to” - quoted from this heart-warming book. In the pandemic period, the best thing we can do is to calm ourselves down and take this opportunity to rest our minds and embrace the surroundings. Don’t dwell on the negativity, instead focus on treating yourself with more compassion and always choose happiness.    2. Declutter the digital to-do lists and documents          This is the best time to practice mindfulness and minimal living. Start with your to do lists and hundreds of folders in your computer. If you are working with a digital to-do list app, export your documents to create backup files. If you are having troubles finding your file in your local drive, start auditing your computer.    Stop making excuses to start practicing digital minimalist lifestyle. A digital declutter starts with removing all optional apps and overdue tasks from your phone and your to-do list. You can go through every existing file to make sure you need them for future reference or you are just projecting your FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). You can also go through the mailbox and start unsubscribing from any mailing lists that you are looped in. Organizing your mailbox can easily help you pass a couple of hours by without feeling too overwhelmed.   3. Enrich yourself by learning a new language          You don’t have to be fluent in French by the time the lockdown is lifted but at least now you have time to learn something else besides Je t’aime or Bonjour! There’s no better way to pass the time, be productive and keep your mind sharp than learning a new language.    You can use a Kanban board to track your learning progress. Add new vocabulary in the to-do column and move them forward to the complete column as you remember them. You can even invite your friends to start a learning challenge with you by comparing notes and see how many words you can remember within one week.    🔖 Learn more about Kanban Swimlanes and how they can boost your productivity   4. Knock out some to-dos on your list          Island hopping on Animal Crossing sounds fun, but how about taking a small break from the virtual world? You want to feel active and alive even when you’re locked at home? Get on the to-do list you’ve been putting off forever. If you are a project manager, take this time as a precious opportunity to evaluate new ideas and maybe you can come up with a breakthrough when the lockdown finishes. Maybe you have some complicated projects that you have been procrastinating on since forever, now may be the good time to start tackling the first tasks in the to-do list.   People may feel stressed from doing nothing and making no value (it’s a real cause of depression, Google it!). Now you have time to do something, don’t waste it on HBO or Netflix. Even though you may not be doing anything productive to cure the coronavirus in particular, completing your to-do list can still give you the satisfaction feeling.      5. Just breathe and take a break from life          You might be fed up with all of the cliches telling you to meditate and relax. However, you still need to learn to stop your mind from freaking out from all of the negative thoughts. Stop checking the data and numbers about coronavirus every hour. This is a highly contagious virus, the number will keep going up, the curve has not been flatten yet, and when the lockdown is over, you will get notified. There is nothing you can do about this situation.    Indulging yourself with meditation, journaling, or even starting your own podcast channel. The post COVID-19 world will change forever. Take this time period to prepare yourself with the change. We are all in this together, but not everyone can come out of this pandemic with a better version of themselves.    That’s all for today! We hope you already have some ideas to stay productive and sane during this pandemic period. What’s your story? Let us know in the comment section below or tweet us at @quire_io 😍   ",

        "title": "Introducing Quire Mobile 5.0 and Everything You Need to Know",
        "excerpt": "   We have been keeping a secret from you - and now the mystery is revealed! We can’t be more excited to introduce you with Quire Mobile 5.0 - a brand new chapter for both Quire iOS and Android users!    What can you expect to see in this major update? Faster performance, more user-focused interface, all-new tabbed navigation, dynamic search, new feature, etc., basically everything gets better with the all-new design Quire Mobile 5.0.                   Faster and more stable app performance   Quire Mobile 5.0 brings a major improvement on the performance of both iOS and Android apps! App launches up to 2 times faster, switching between heavy projects is up to 3 times faster and navigation in a complex project is more responsive and up to 50 percent faster. We have optimized the app performance so that you can work on multiple tasks simultaneously without facing a laggy system.   Quire Mobile 5.0 now supports back to iOS 12 and Android 5 to ensure the best performance and users’ experiences.    All-new design navigation bar         Since day one, Quire was designed to be user-oriented and we always try to focus on the users and their needs for a productivity app. Not only do we want Quire to have the most simple and intuitive interface, but we also want our users to experience the most effective workflow that helps them actually get things done.   For dynamic teams working on multiple complex projects, we are more than happy to introduce you with the newly redesigned navigation system. You now have a navigation bar in the bottom corner of the app to give you instant access to your “Home”, “My Tasks”, “Notifications” and “Account”.    Intuitive tabbed navigation:  The new navigation bar enables you to navigate through a series of hierarchical screens. When you are directed to a new page, a back button appears on the left side of the screen to let you go back to your previous view. With the device that has a larger screen, you can tap the same view button to retrace steps through a hierarchy of information instead of using the system-provided back button.    Revamped notification view: Unlike the previous notification section which was designed for view only with very limited controls, the new notification lets you view tasks and jump between projects more easily.  You can either use the back button or tap “Notification” on the navigation bar to go back to your notification list.   Quickly visit projects: When you’re redirected to a task from a particular view, either “My Tasks” or “Notification”, there is a bar that appears on the upper screen that lets you visit the project of that particular task. Tap the back button continuously to go back to the previous screen that you wish to view.    “The new design goes beyond the basics, removes non-functional steps and frees up the limitation of our brains’ thinking process. You can quickly access and switch between tasks, projects and organizations. Every detail, every tap, every icon on the screen is carefully designed to yield the most meaningful experience to our users. If there’s a functionality that you want to use in the app, it’s already there waiting for you.”, said Jerry Chen, Senior Software Engineer at Quire. “It’s always our top priority to create the most intuitive workflow for our users to achieve their goals, and we can’t wait for everyone to try out the new version of Quire Mobile App.”      Quire Sublist comes to mobile app         Earlier this year, we introduced Quire Sublist as a powerful feature to let you create your own customized and personalized list of several important tasks. At the dropdown menu under the Project’s name, you can create a sublist and choose the tasks to add to your newly created sublist.     🔖 Read more on how a sublist can change the way you work to achieve higher goals   Your sublist will mirror the main list, which means whatever you do to your task in the main list, the changes will be made in the sublist as well and vice versa. For one project, you can have an unlimited number of sublists to share with either project’s members, external team or yourself.    More powerful and reliable Search functionality         Search Views include lists of tasks, projects, organizations, smart folders or members that meet the criteria you specify. When searching for tasks, you can choose the scope that you want to search for, either “Active Tasks”, “All Tasks”, “Completed Tasks” or “Peekaboo Tasks”.    The search dialogue also shows the recent history of your search so that you can quickly access your previous search results.    The ultimate productivity app for your future achievements   Quire Mobile 5.0 introduces a dramatic new app interface and the smoothest workflow for our users to achieve all of the dreams and ambitions. From optimizing the app performance to redesigning the new look, we hope to bring you the most reliable productivity app to work with your teams and actually get things done.    Quire Mobile 5.0 is available today as a free software update on App Store and Google Play Store. Get your latest update of the app to enjoy the brand-new experience.

        "title": "Coronavirus Outbreak: How to Work From Home and Still Stay Productive",
        "excerpt": "   If you received a message from your supervisor today telling you to start working from home, don’t freak out! Take this as an opportunity to take care of your health, practice social distancing and help slow the spread of coronavirus among society.    Global companies such as Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Apple, Amazon, Spotify, etc. have implemented mandatory work-from-home policies amid the Coronavirus pandemic (yes, WHO has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic).     First rule to deal with the novel Coronavirus pandemic is to stay calm. Don’t panic even if this is your first work-at-home experience! Don’t freak out if you have to practice social distancing and stop going outside.    Though remote work is a new trend that many big tech firms have already embraced, many employees are still struggling with the whole concept of working while still wearing pajamas. Technology adoption, social isolation, communication glitches, anxiety can all become the challenges from a work-at-home newbie.    Today in this blog post, as a team that already implemented remote working culture for years, we will tell you some of the work-at-home survival guides, from setting up your new office to the way you collaborate with your team from afar.    1. Stick to the same schedule          It’s not because now you’re working from your kitchen, you can wake up at 11am and turn on your laptop after a huge brunch. Many people have fallen into a productivity slump just because they let go of their schedule for “one cheat day”. Of course, your day can start one hour later than the usual schedule since you don’t have to commute to work anymore. However, try to stick to the same routine. Get your morning coffee and start your laptop around 9am. If you’re used to making a to-do list for everyday’s tasks, keep this habit even when you’re not in the office.   🔖 Read more on how to use a to do list app for remote teams    Don’t mix up the chores when you’re working at home. Think of it as a “new office”, but you’re still doing your job from 9-5. If you never vacuum your cubicle or do laundry at 10am on a Monday morning, don’t start doing these houseworks just because you’re working at home. The key is to set boundaries for tasks that you can conveniently do and the tasks that you should not do during your working hours.    2. Invest more on communication skills (or tools!)   Virus outbreak or not, you should always work on your communication skill and have a reliable tool to collaborate with your teams. Many employees might experience anxiety if they cannot have face-to-face meetings or check in with their boss everyday (this anxiety also happens the other way around as well).           With remote work, both managers and employees are forced to engage in virtual communication. If emails aren’t the best way to communicate with your managers, use a project management software app to record your working progress and keep your team updated as well.    Social isolation can also be a potential threat to your productivity when you are working from home. Even introverts will suffer from loneliness when working alone at home. The best advice is not to wait for others to reach out, when you practice social distancing, you can actually be more active to communicate with your teams and your managers. Don’t isolate yourself in the fortress of solitude, remember everyone is experiencing the same frustration that you’re having now.       3. Stay away from the distractions          Working at home means you will be around your television and your fridge a lot. Those distractions can kill your productivity and make you less motivated at your job. Normally we would advise you to go to a coffee shop or a co-working space, but during the coronavirus outbreak, we should all stay inside to the fullest extent instead of wandering on the street.    However, just because you’re trapped at home, it doesn&#39;t mean you cannot create your own work space. No matter how tempting it is to stay in the kitchen or in the bedroom, you’re best off setting up a workstation for yourself. You should have a proper desk and bring all of your laptop and documents to your station instead of laying around in bed or on the sofa. Treat your workstation as your real cubicle, turn off your cell phone, sit straight up and have your coffee mug only instead of a huge meal next to your laptop.    Recreating your familiar work space signals your brain and tricks your mind that you’re still working at your usual office. Your mind will be mentally prepared into the “This is my office and I’m at work” mindset. The transition can be made easier and you won’t find it too hard to do your job all alone anymore.    4. Be transparent with the work progress   One of the main obstacles for remote work culture is to build trust between team members. A flexible schedule means everyone has the luxury of working around their own timetables. Nonetheless, how can a manager make sure you’re actually doing your job instead of sipping your Maitai by the pool on a Wednesday afternoon?    Managers of a remote team need to be highly credible in order for the team to function properly. During the time when everyone mandatorily works from home, employees are also required to be honest and open about their shortcomings. As you’re already isolated from your teammates, hiding your problems can only worsen your situation and eventually ruin everyone’s productivity.    Also, since you cannot see your teammates on a daily basis, at least be available when your presence is requested. When face-to-face communication is removed, there will be a lot of emails that need to be RSVP as soon as possible. Check in with your project managers more often, reach out more regularly with your team members via DMs, use the project management software to track the working progress with your team and be transparent about it. 🔖 Read more on how managers use Kanban Board to ensure team productivity      5. Get some fresh air and be positive          It is indeed unfortunate to be forced to work from home and be apart with your boss and co-workers (not sarcastic, I swear!). We never know how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, unless you’re working in a research lab for the coronavirus vaccine, washing your hands and staying inside are the only things you can do to help stop the virus spreading.   Thousands of businesses all over the world are taking a hit on the revenue and having to lay off hundreds of the employees. Thousands of people are out of job everyday, so if you’re still working even miles away from your office, be thankful that at least you still receive your payslip by the end of the month. Mandatory remote working culture can be a stressor that makes employees sink deep into the anxiety. No one wants to be forced to stay inside, even the most introverted ones.    If you’re a manager, it’s your job to keep the team’s spirit up and assure them about their future. If this is your first time working remotely, take it as an opportunity to work independently without anyone looking over your shoulder.

        "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Kanban Swimlanes for Better Project Management",
        "excerpt": "   The hot season is coming and you are more than ready to jump into the pool to enjoy the summertime happiness and the sunkissed glow! Though we’re also very excited for the flip-flops season, today we’re gonna to let you know about a type of Swimlanes. It’s not the kind that lets you slide right into a swimming pool, instead if you master the use of Kanban Swimlanes, you can actually enjoy your summer in peace knowing everything is under control and your projects are going in the right track.    🔖 Read more about how to utilize Nested Tasks and Kanban Board for your team productivity   What is Kanban Swimlanes?   Kanban board is a productivity method that takes advantage of the limited work-in-progress (WIP).  By laying out a limited number of tasks into columns, Kanban board helps you visualize the workflow in a short period of time. At the very basic level, Kanban board lets you have three columns that include many “sticky notes” within each column.    To Do  Doing Completed   When you are working on your tasks with a Kanban board, chances are you will move the tasks around and use different ways to best visualize your workflow. So when you decide to split your original columns into different parallel lanes that represent some unique project milestones or workload, you are creating Kanban Swimlanes.          Source: Giphy   Kanban board and Swimlanes are very popular in agile project management because they force teams to prioritize and concentrate on the right tasks at the right time. Imagine choosing some crucial tasks from your ever-growing task list and drag to a Kanban board, now those tasks are beautifully laid out in the form of sticky notes with the status attached to. You can measure and make an estimated guess on the tasks progress at a glance.      How can your productivity be benefited by the Swimlanes?   1. Visualize tasks based on the priority level      When you sort your Kanban board by priority, you have created Kanban Swimlanes with the tasks based on their priorities. The most urgent tasks will be put in the top of the list, which indicates that your team must concentrate and give full devotion to those tasks. The highest priority tasks are also divided into different columns, based on the working statuses. With this new layout, you can now visualize your next coming steps and highlight what tasks need to be completed first.   2. Balancing team allocation effectively      Depending on the nature of your project and the size of the team, workload allocation is a crucial step to manage team productivity. Different team members play different roles in the team, therefore, a manager should create a Kanban Swimlane by sorting the task list by assignees to have the overview of the entire work process.   In the above example, you can tell Brent has to work on a lot of tasks, whilst Beverly has only one task. Obviously, as a team leader, you would have to balance out the workload between team members to improve the team productivity.    3. Managing tasks based on the users’ stories or phases      You can utilize the Kanban board by using the tags to sort your tasks. By separating the tasks based on each tag, you can measure the workload for each tag by looking at the swimlanes.    For example, your team is working on the tasks for several different phases, you can create a specific tag for each phase then sort the tasks by the newly created tags. By creating the swimlanes for each tag, you decide which phase that needs to pay extra attention to.  Kanban Board and Kanban Swimlanes are the future of productivity   Many agile project management experts have praised how a physical board and sticky notes have changed their work life. However, this low-tech approach only works if your team is working in the same building everyday. As many global companies decided to embrace the remote working culture, managers need to find a way to help teams envision their work process even when everyone is working with completely different time zones!           Source: Giphy   A cloud-based Kanban board lets your team quickly visualize what they have to pay attention to for the next couple weeks. With the Swimlanes, every task is laid out neatly with all of the visual elements put in parallel, team productivity is transparent and each team member can get an extra boost to organize their own tasks or make adjustments if necessary.

        "title": "Best 5 tips to Use a Digital To Do List for Remote Teams during a Virus Outbreak",
        "excerpt": "   If you are following the news recently, you already knew about how 2020 kickstarted with the worst epidemic ever. While we are all hoping for the best that the current Coronavirus outbreak will not accelerate to a pandemic phase, many international corporations like Twitter and government authorities have embraced the remote working culture in order to stop the virus spreading.    Working remotely has been a trend for dynamic companies and will continue to grow in the upcoming years. Many managers have mistaken a global remote team means having a stable internet connection; however, internet and trust issues  are just half of the remote working equation. One of the challenges for collaborating with remote teams is to ensure the team productivity and work efficiency.    Imagine your team is working from different locations with different time zones, what is the best way to communicate and keep everyone on the same page? Despite what’s going on with the virus outbreak, you cannot tell the Director Board the reason why your team cannot perform at the highest levels is that they work from home most of the time.    Virtual collaboration will soon become the work trend for this new decade, even when the outbreak is over. Managers have acknowledged the power of remote work and started to operate the companies across time zones. Since remote collaboration and communication don’t come with a handbook, this article will share with you how to use a simple digital to do list to keep your team connected.       1. Keep the to-do list neat and let go of the micromanagement   One of the worst mistakes that managers make when preparing the to do list for their team is to give out too much unnecessary information. Maybe it’s the micro-management style that a manager has to observe closely to the smallest details, but remote working culture isn’t about controlling the subordinates or teammates.    A digital to do list can be optimized in the virtual working environment if managers or team leaders remember to narrow down their lists to these four critical information:     Project objective: what is the ultimate outcome of this project?  Important milestones to achieve: be specific about tasks, the due date and due time, clearly define the definition of done  Person-in-charge: who should do what and report to whom Feedback and reports: create detailed guidelines for common roadblocks    🔖 Read more on what project manager did wrong   When listing down the tasks for your team, be specific with what exactly you expect them to complete and attach only the necessary resources to help them achieve the project goal. Never create an information maze that does nothing but drive your team insane.    2. Tracking team performance and communicate more often      Most  of the to do list apps can help you track the project’s progress closely and how each team member performs. Though micromanagement is proven as a poison for productivity, it’s always a good idea to stay close to your team and give feedback when necessary. Communicate before it’s too late.    Remote teams usually struggle with communications - instead of barging in your supervisor’s office, you have to schedule an appointment and wait until the time slot is open. When you are working with a team that is located all over the world, face-to-face meetings are nearly impossible. But you still have to create an environment for your team to voice about their opinions and as receive honest feedback and suggestions from managers.    A good to do list can help a remote team collaborate seamlessly by replacing all of the meetings in real life with a stable platform to engage team members and support team bonding through virtual offices.    3. Customize different sublists for each team member      It’s no longer a myth that we do our best work only when our minds are clear and focused. Collaborating on a shared task list can fail to improve productivity as there are too many distractions and irrelevant information. If you feel lost too often with your team’s shared to do list, chances are your productivity will drop like a rock.    So what’s the solution here? Besides a “master to do list”, you should always create your own customized sublist. Start off with the easiest tasks or the ones that have the most recent due dates. Split the team’s complicated task list into a simpler, smaller  and easier to accomplish to do list.    Now instead of looking at a huge to do list with too many people working on it at once, you can have your own little view to focus. If something else comes up in the master list and you think it’s relevant to your job, just simply drag and drop the newly added task to your personalized to do list.    By working side-by-side with two to do lists, you are fully in control of how you want to handle your tasks and in which way you want to tackle the to do list.     🔖 Read more on how to best use Quire Sublist to improve personal productivity    4. Share a weekly agenda with the team      There is one simple way to make sure to keep everyone on your remote team on the same page is to send out a work agenda every week. Quire is an example of how a to do list app should handle the weekly updates. For a project, a team leader can sort all of the tasks by Due Per Week and share the tasks block with the team members. Now that everyone is clear about when to do what and who is the person-in-charge for each task, productivity slump can never be a problem anymore.    5. Take advantages of an automatic documentation system   Remote working culture means a lot of memos and digital notes instead of the traditional yellow patch. If you are a super organized person, congratulations! But if you are having troubles with finding your notes every time your boss asks for it, try to embrace the automatic documentation system of a to do list app.           As complicated as it sounds, actually an automatic documentation system means gathering all of your important notes and key discussions then uploading to the shared to do list app between your team members. All of the documents will be saved securely and it’s so much easier to share and reference those information later.       One of the reasons why a digital to do list is the future for team productivity is the search function. All documents can be easily searched for and the information transparency can be guaranteed.    There is no big secret when it comes to focusing your mind and getting things done. We’ve already made it through a fifth of the 21st Century and it’s time to embrace the remote working culture as a new trend to boost productivity and ward off unnecessary distractions. Building a global remote team can take a village, but talented people from across the world can still successfully collaborate as long as leaders can choose the best platform for the team to thrive.   During the difficult time, we hope Quire can be a part of your successful stories. Share your thoughts with us on Twitter @quire_io or email us at feedback@quire.io. Stay healthy!   ",

        "title": "Top 12 Quire Hacks that Make Your Productivity Great Again",
        "excerpt": "   It’s still the first quarter of 2020, and somehow if you are fighting the holiday or seasonal slump, we totally get it! Team productivity can slow down a bit with all of the cluttered task list, messy organization and awkward communication. In the spirit of sharing, in this post, we will let you know some of the top-notch Quire tips and hacks to make your life (and work) so much easier!    1. Turn on Advanced Mode for more details   Let’s face it, too much information is a serious problem. How can you focus on what needs to be done when you are presented with thousands of irrelevant information? When we first developed Quire years ago, our main concern was which information is considered important to users. A platform with the right amount of presented information will help users with their productivity, instead of diluting their focus.       If you think your project doesn’t show enough information, chances are you have turned off the Advanced Mode. There’s a cool tip here: hit Ctrl on Windows or Alt on MacOS or simply shake your phone to enable the Advanced Mode.    Now look at the task list, isn’t it everything that you are looking for? We chose to hide some of the information that we personally think it’s not relevant, but in case we are wrong, here you go.    Wait! Are you too confused with this “brand-new” view now? Let us walk you through some of the hidden gems in the Advanced Mode.    First, you can view all tags in full name instead of being cut off. Then if you like to make unlimited subtasks, there is a small icon that indicates how many subtasks you have under a single parent task.    Moreover, Advanced Mode lets you know if a task contains a description, a comment or an attachment. The unique task ID will also show on the list so that it’s easier for you to track each task.    2. Expand progress bar to view the progress of each task      If you’re a Quirean for a long time, you already knew about the Overview page. It provides a comprehensive report of how your project goes. But did you know each task has its own overview section as well?    In the detail panel, under the Description section, you will see a line that says [#] incomplete and [#] completed subtasks. Click to expand and you can view a pie chart that summarizes the progress of the parent task and its subtasks. You can also view the clickable first-level subtasks as well. Cool, isn’t it?      3. Right-click to access Context Menu   There are so many exciting features that we want first-time users to know, but we don’t want you to be so overwhelmed with all of the information. That’s why we keep everything in a special menu called the Context Menu and you can right click to access it.       In the context menu, there are so many things you can do for your task. If you are not a keyboard shortcut person, this context menu will be your life-saver!   4. Add a cover for your task in Kanban Board   Wanna spice things up for your Kanban Board? You can always add a photo as an attachment to your task and use it as a cover. Now your board looks more like a beautiful canvas for you to get started on your tasks!      Maybe you already know this tip if you’re a Kanban Board lover, we just want to remind you again that you can always add multiple boards for one project to show different milestones!   5. Quickly navigate using Tab and Drag-and-Drop function      At Quire, we take the Tab very seriously. With a simple Tab button, you can navigate throughout the whole workspace. Just keep pressing Tab to jump to the next section in Quire. And how can you go back to the previous section? Hit the combo Shift + Tab and there you go, right where you should have stopped.    Sometimes when you don’t want to use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + X and Ctrl + V, you can actually drag and drop your tasks to wherever you want them to be. Easy peasy!    6. Getting notified with the right notifications   Not every notification means the same - we got that! Too many notifications can drive a person crazy, that’s why we let our users configure which notifications that they want to receive for one project.       You can choose which  notifications that you want to receive for your project in the project options. Also, if you want to manage your reminder settings, go to your Account Settings} and set the reminder however you want.       7. Sometimes one isn’t enough   As one of the most frequently asked questions for our support team, everyone seems to care a lot about how to do everything in a batch mode in Quire.    If you want to multiple administer several tasks, you can first use Ctrl + Arrow (or Cmd) to select the tasks you want to make changes to; then there is a menu that appears at the bottom of the page.       Now you can add assignees, due dates, tags, status, etc. to multiple tasks.    If you want to assign a task to multiple assignees, you can hover to the member email address and there’s a small + button on the right side. Keep clicking on the + button to add more assignees to your task.       8. Create unlimited Sublists for one project   Last month, we had a blast on our product launch on Producthunt! We introduced our ultimate sublist feature for the first time and so many people LOVE it!    We know with an ever-growing task list with no end in sight, you can get tired and unmotivated easily.  Now with the Quire Sublist, you can create as many sublists as you want for your project! The sublist behaves as a magic mirror that mimics what you do to your tasks in the main task list.       As easy as it sounds, you can add a sublist to your project and start dragging-and-dropping your tasks to the newly created sublist! When you want to remove the tasks from a sublist, just drag and drop them back from the sublist to the main list! Super intuitive, we know!    If you are curious about this feature, you can visit this blog post or this tutorial for Sublist.    9. Dynamic Filter and Sorting options      Sometimes you have to be creative with the sorting option in order to organize your task list better. With Quire dynamic sorting, you can hover through the sorting options, click on the + button then sort your task list by two levels.       If you’re a tag lover, you will love to filter those tags using Boolean AND, OR, NOT! There’s nothing better than a neat view with all of the organized tasks!   10. Bookmark everything, even your filter      No one has time to go over hundreds of projects to find the one you need! Next time, just bookmark the projects that you usually have to view and they will show up in the Bookmark section!       Saved filter is a special feature that lets you set filter and sorting conditions for your task list then save them as a new filter for quick access. The best thing is, your saved filters will be synced across devices so when you created a saved filter with your browser, your mobile will automatically sync!    11. Get your task list styled with Markdown!      So many users have asked how to get their task list as beautiful as our screenshots; and the answer is: Markdown!    Basically, there are sets of rules that create rich text easily and quickly. Here is the list of our favorite markdown. If you are also a keyboard lover, we have some shortcuts that guarantee to make your life easier! Be honest here, who has time to use the mouse even if it’s Magic Mouse, right?!   12. Responsive graph to show detailed progress within a specific time period      The project overview graph in Quire isn’t a boring graph! This chronological graph shows the progress of your task list, how many tasks are completed and how many tasks left that need to be taken care of.    But do you know if you use your mouse to select a specific time period, let’s say from Nov 23 to Jan 4, the graph will show more detailed progress. When you are presenting your project overview, this tip really comes in handy to show your work! You can always click on Reset zoom to reset your graph to the original state as well.    That’s all for today! If your team is struggling with all of the productivity problems, we hope these tips and tricks can help you achieve great things!

        "title": "Quire Sublist: Bridge the Gap between Team To Do Lists and Personal Productivity",
        "excerpt": "   Do you ever think how amazing it would feel to make the tasks in your to do list disappear and accomplish everything you set out for the day, so you can go home early then continue where you left off with your favorite Netflix show? However, more often, life won’t go as planned, especially when you are working on a complex project with so many team members. By day’s end, the team’s shared task list looks like a matrix and no one would ever know where to get started. With so many team members working on the same list, it&#39;s mostly impossible to identify your tasks and how to connect all the dots together.    🔖 Read more on how to avoid burnout at work   We know you’ve tried your best to optimize your productivity, but sometimes life gets in the way. At Quire, we never let the stress win and make you feel less of yourself. It&#39;s not you, it’s the way your team works with the to do list. Today, in order to solve the frustration and distraction problems once and for all, we introduce you with the ultimate Quire Sublist - the feature that will change the way you deal with your task list forever.       Personalize the Way You View Your Team Goals   We’ve all been through this: sitting in conference rooms for hours on end where nothing gets done. Everyone has the same proposal and same action plan, but somehow you look at the eye of your teammates and you realize you two share the same feeling: I have absolutely no idea what is going on.    Lost in translation happens more often than you thought. No matter how good your communication skill is, everyone has very different ideas when it comes to interpreting a to do list. The tasks that matter to a manager may not mean that much to a staff. Letting team members have the ability to create a personalized list is the secret to getting things done.       Tip: You can create as many sublists as you want and set different view permission for each sublist.   For one project in Quire, you can have as many sublists as you wish. For example, you might create a sublist named Design Reference and put all of the tasks/subtasks that are related to the task of Design Reference. Instead of creating a matrix of tags that drive all of the project members crazy, with your own personalized sublist, you can focus on the right tasks at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.   And when you are working with the sublists, you can always switch back to the “master” list at any time to view all of the tasks shared between team members and the big picture of your project.     🔖 Learn more on how to create a Sublist   Tackle To Do Lists As a Winning Team   We encourage you and your team to dream big but keep the to-do list relevant and straight to the point. If you have too many things to look at, you will end up not knowing where to focus on. Same thing with your to-do list, if there are too many tasks laying around, you will get lost before you even start working on your list.   You can build in as many tasks as you want, your team members can also contribute to the task list and eventually create a big picture on how to achieve team goals. The brainstorming process can last forever until your team gets on the same page. However, when your team sits down at the desk and start working on the task list, you can use Quire Sublist to create a shorter version of the ever-growing list and focus on the tasks that matter to each individual only.       Tip: You can select the same tasks and create different sublists.   There are often some team members working together on the same section of the project. Quire Sublist was born to help you create a focused view for yourself and moreover, for the project members and even the external team that share the same workload.  If you are a team manager, for example, you can select several crucial tasks related to the Phase 1 of the Product Development and create a sublist named Phase 1 then share with your team members.

        "title": "Best New Year's Resolutions that You Can Actually Keep in 2020",
        "excerpt": "   January has been proven to be the busiest time of the year for fitness and productivity tool industries. Funny how for the last 365 days, not so many people think of starting a healthy diet or practicing a proven productivity method to get things done. However, in the first day of the New Year, people around the world are beginning to reflect on the past year and start making resolutions hoping to achieve all of their dreams this year.    The common problem with New Year’s resolutions is that it’s always easier said than done. You are determined to buy your first house by the end of this year, you swear with your friends that your favorite jeans will come off a bit easier in the next three months, you promise yourself that your credit card installment will be settled by July… whatever the case, after a few months into the New Year, you might realize, in your mind, everything tends to work out for the best and you always win, but somehow it doesn’t look that way in real life.    To prepare for this year&#39;s resolutions, you started to google “What are the easiest New Year’s resolutions to keep?” or “Top 10 New Year’s resolutions” or “How to stop failing and stick to New Year’s resolutions?”. You wonder what you could possibly have done wrong in the past. The good news is, you are not alone. Research shows that 60 percent of us make New Year’s resolutions while only 8 percent can actually achieve them. Probably in the last several years, the odds just aren’t in your favor.    Well, 2020 should be different as it marks a brand new decade. We want to kickstart a decade with a clean slate. Instead of keep making general resolutions as “losing weight” or “saving up”, we will tell you some awesome easy New Year’s resolutions that are not too difficult to keep for you to be more productive in 2020.           1. Create a simple doable task list   It’s already 20 years into the 2000s, stop trying to be Superman. Don’t keep adding on your to-do list and by the end of the day, your own list will discourage you from achieving your goal. People tend to fall into the blue funk when their to-do list gets really overwhelming and unwieldy with thousands of to-dos and no end in sight.   Everyone wants to move mountains, but you have to start small in order to achieve a big dream. Years ago, we have proposed how you should abandon your to-do list since we realized a to-do list no longer serves its original purpose when the number of tasks is too large to render them equally important. You shouldn’t have a plain list either, use a hierarchical to-do list instead to break down your goal into digestible tasks.      Take time to step back and evaluate your current to-do list. If there are more than 10 tasks for you everyday, chances are you might give up on your own list in the next couple weeks. Stay minimal when it comes to setting up a new goal. You have to work on your goal constantly, just like Rome wasn’t built in one day.    2. Treat yourself better and say no to stress          Everyone is obsessed with the fast-paced life, “make more money, it’s better to cry in a Ferrari than on a public bus” - they said. After all of the extra hours you are putting in at work hoping for a better paycheck by the end of the month, you might as well ask yourself if everything is worth the stress.    It’s not always just your body, sometimes your mind breaks as well. You are always on the race to complete as many tasks as possible. Your happiness seems to depend on your quarterly KPI. In 2020, be your own hero by taking care of your mental health and putting yourself first.    One of the favorite tricks from famous entrepreneurs to achieve higher productivity at work is that you can start your day with a simple task and accelerate from there. Try not to think of a big goal that might stress you out, just pick up some routine tasks to ease yourself into the process. Keep yourself happy instead of busy.    3. Keep a journal and count your blessings   If you always feel doomed and unhappy with your life, whining about it won’t make any difference.  You cannot sit still and expect life to eventually make sense one day just like some of the best-selling self-help books write about. There’s something called “personal growing process” and it means you need to give yourself some time to grow and achieve your goals.           Keeping a journal can help you reflect on yourself and see how much you’ve changed and improved. You don’t have to write a whole 1000-word essay for your journal entry. Keep it short and straight-to-the-point. Just write some short entries everyday even when that day is uneventful and plain. The point is to jot down a couple of thoughts and things that happened and how you feel about it.    If you are not fond of writing, taking photos and putting them into an organized list can also do the trick. Your to-do list doesn’t have to be a real to-do list, be creative and use the task as a daily journal entry. After a while, you can revisit your journal and realize even when you don’t think you made any progress, everything actually has changed and you’re no longer standing in your original spot anymore.    4. Do something different at least once a month   Boredom can not only kill your joy but also kill your productivity. But a lot of people are hesitant of changes. The problem is when thinking about changes, everyone thinks of something huge, like moving across the country or learn how to skydiving. You will get excited for a couple of days (or weeks!) but soon after the honeymoon phase is over, welcome back to the loop of hell!   Instead of breaking your routine all at once, start with some small details: try to take another road on the way home from work, dine in a new opening restaurant nearby, wear a colorful shirt to work instead of suits and ties, etc.  Happiness can come from small details that sometimes go unnoticed.           5. Stick to the resolutions even if you fail several times before   There is no particular reason when it comes to the reason why people keep failing their resolutions. Life happens and your busy schedule gets in the way. A lot of people sign up for a fitness program and after accidentally skip the cardio class once or twice, they start to give up for good. If you don’t want to start over, don’t quit. But even if you already quit several times, starting over still seems better than doing nothing.    Whatever in your New Year’s resolution list, just start right now for your trial period. Don’t procrastinate and wait until January 1, 2020 to start going to the gym or opening a saving account. Who cares if you binge over the holiday break or miss a few leg days, just stick to your diet whenever you can. Train your mind to be committed to your ultimate goal and your resolutions’ list.    Every December the internet will be flooded with thousands of articles to tell you how to keep your New Year’s resolutions and you will keep telling yourself this year would be different. Most New Year’s resolutions will be broken during the first month. We hope you are strong enough to force yourself to stick to your goals through March at least, then you will notice it is easier to keep this resolution when it becomes a habit already.    No matter what resolution is on your list this year, we hope you will achieve your dreams in 2020.

        "title": "What a year it’s been: Looking back at the incredible journey with Quire in 2019",
        "excerpt": "   If you feel like the last 365 days just flown by in a blink, well, you are not alone. Christmas is rolling around and soon we will be making toasts celebrating another promising 365 days. By all accounts, 2019 has been a remarkable year for us at Quire and we would like to take a moment and share with you the incredible journey of the last 12 months.    Robust and reliable experience wrapped in the most elegant interface   Quire is committed to bringing you the most powerful features and still keeping the clean and elegant interface. On the surface, you might not notice the differences, but in the last 365 days, we have enhanced a lot of existing not-so-obvious functions along with created several breakthroughs with the new features.    One of the fascinating features that captures everyone’s hearts is Peekaboo. Our philosophy when developing Quire is to get focused on your work and get things done. Peekaboo feature was born to tuck away the irrelevant tasks in your list and let you come back and work on those tasks later. We want to deliver the amazing feeling of confidence in getting goals accomplished rather than let you worry about your task list.   For years a lot of Quireans have raised the attention to us for more dynamic sorting and filtering options. We’ve heard you loud and clear. We made some adjustments and improvements to let you be creative with the sorting and filtering. Now that you are free to view your to-do lists however you want.    Make your work faster, smarter and more interesting   2019 marks another milestone for Quire team when we introduced the first version ever of Quire Open API. We truly believe the sky’s the limit and with Quire Open API, you can build scripts and integrate your favorite applications with Quire. Also, we introduced a brand new Quire App Directory for our users to search for the integrations and make Quire a better and more complete tool.    We believe high productivity starts with daily routines. In 2019, we redesigned and released My Tasks II so that you can start your day with a clean slate. Instead of getting lost in your to-do list, now you can have your own task list that includes only the tasks that are relevant to you. Before, when adding a task, you have to be specific about the project that the task goes into. With the renovated My Tasks II, don’t worry, you can start adding the task to your My Tasks.    Connect team members and bring simplicity to teamwork   Helping team to accomplish dreams and goals is always Quire’s core value. There are more than 100,000 teams trusted Quire with their projects. We have helped ten thousands of remote teams to connect and collaborate together.    The one thing that all of the teams on Quire shares in common  is that they work remotely with thousands of tasks assigned for dozens of team members. They have no time to get bogged down in project management.  As a dynamic team ourselves, we value simplicity over complexity. No one got time to learn a complicated system before actually getting things done.    In 2019, Quire has been available in another 3 languages: Japanese, Spanish and French. It’s always our ultimate goal to connect global team remotely and create a culture of trust and productivity. With 7 languages in total, we hope to deliver a reliable platform to bring diverse teams together (even if you are thousands of miles apart!).    We are as excited about 2020 as you are…   It still feels unreal to think how the last 20 years of the 2000s just flashed by and here we are, ready to conquer the next goals in life. As a team, we know how challenging it is when it comes to project management. But we also know how wonderful it feels when you finally achieve your dream!   Thank you for being a part of this marvelous journey with us! Everything is possible because of you and your continuous support for Quire. We couldn’t have made this far if it’s not for you :)    Get ready for 2020 - a brand new chapter that will bring hope, opportunities and success to you and your team. We are very excited for what the future holds for Quire in 2020. Follow us on Twitter to get the latest updates and news from Quire!   Happy Holidays Greetings from all of us!   ",

        "title": "Meet Quire Team: Our Favorite Productivity Things in 2019",
        "excerpt": "   There are thousands of books, videos and blog posts available everywhere to teach you how to get more productive. The problem is, those pieces of advice can get very cliche and most of the time, you will forget everything you’ve just read in just 10 minutes, let alone follow the tips to improve your productivity.   As a team who specializes in creating a tool to help everyone with workload efficiency, Quire team has put together a list of our favorites to keep a healthy work-life balance and help you improve your productivity in 2020!    Top Productivity Apps: Quire, Slack, Google Drive   A good to-do list is an essential tool for anyone who wants to improve productivity. By writing down all of the things you have to do in one day or one week, you have a big picture of your task list so that you can steer your mind to focus on what really matters instead of being all over the place.    Quire provides users an infinite nested task list so that you can write down whatever in your mind and organize those tasks into a hierarchical order. Unlike the common flat task list that other project management software offers, a nested to-do list provides the logical hierarchy to accommodate more complex tasks and make team collaboration easier.   As a remote team that works in different locations and sometimes different timezone, it’s critical for Quire to find the most effective way to communicate. We’ve been using Slack integration with Quire for years to message and collaborate with other members. Many international companies with remote working culture such as Google, Amazon, Apple, etc. also swear by a good communicating system to enhance the team collaboration.   If you ever work on a huge project that requires all hands on deck, up to a point you will get very frustrated with all of the scattered information and paperwork. Quire team isn’t an exception. However, thanks to the integration between Quire and Google Drive, we create a file cabinet to securely store everything, from  the documents, presentations to photos on Google Drive and link them to the relevant tasks on Quire. This way, all of the information is centralized and can be accessed from anywhere at anytime.      Top Productivity Hacks: Create time block, Break the Myth of Multitasking, KonMari’d your task list   We are a dynamic team that often has to manage several on-going projects at the same time. You might guess all of us are multitaskers, however, on the contrary, we do not believe in multitasking.    Breaking the Myth of Multitasking   Studies from the University of Sussex and University of London found that multitasking can harm your performance, let your productivity take a hit, and even damage your brain. Multitasking only works if the tasks are second nature to you, which means you can complete the task without thinking too much about it. For instance, you can take a shower and listen to music at the same time, since those two tasks do not require “critical thinking” to complete. However, working on different tasks at the same time for a complex project that requires real thoughts will not be that easy.    Instead of trying to multitask our way, Quire team deployed the new method called “serial tasking” using a clean task list to constantly work on individual tasks and eventually complete the whole project. We also use Kanban board to track the project progress as well as other team members’ workload.   KonMari’d your projects   The KonMari method lets you declutter your house and even your workspace. We are often caught in the rush at work, drown in hundreds of emails everyday and overwhelmed with the never-ending task list.    When Quire team first deployed the KonMari method in our daily job, we started with the mailbox and the task list. Label every email and every task based on the priority, due dates, and team members. Now your task list and mailbox do not look like a digital apocalypse anymore and you can stay on top of what’s most important and respond to the essentials only.   Time block your schedule   9:30am - 11:30am should be reserved for critical tasks that require your full attention because your daily dose of caffeine just finds time to kick in and you’re energetic enough to deal with all of the hassles. You can plan ahead of your time by setting due dates for your tasks or sync your task list to Google Calendar so that you know when you need to finish your tasks. After adding your to-do list to calendar, select a specific time slots and reserve them for the tasks.    Aim to limit your schedule to 4-5 priority tasks per day instead of trying to overachieve and eventually let yourself burn out with your own list. Stay focused and committed to your task list and the time block. If you have set 9:30am - 10:30am for tracking the data analysis, you should stick with the schedule no matter what.    Start a new year with a clean slate!   Brace yourself, New Year is coming! You are going to spend the next 365 days with your work being the central of your life, so start your new year right. Hopefully you’re going to have the best year of your life (and more to come!). We couldn’t be more excited to be a part of your journey!

        "title": "A Closer Look at Quire Redesigned My Tasks II",
        "excerpt": "   Project management is a complicated and demanding process which often involves so many different tasks and people at the same time.  For years, Quire users write us hundreds of feedback suggesting Quire should have a personal list to dump all the mental clutter into and a place to review all of the tasks that are related to themselves only.    Finally, last week, after a long and meticulous journey, we introduced the brand-new redesigned My Tasks II. The new My Tasks is a default list in Quire that allows you to focus on the right thing in the moment, organize your ongoing projects and get things done in a less stressful way.    Curious about how Quire team is using the new My Tasks II to optimize our workflow? Let’s get started!     Capture your cluttered tasks and create a personal task list   You might realize often when you’re multitasking, good ideas come along and you need to write them down. However, you are not sure which project you can add to or you simply don’t want to waste your time scrolling just to find a specific task list. With the new My Tasks II, your problem is solved!    We introduced a brand new type of task called “personal task”. Those tasks are only visible to you and they do not belong to any particular project. Those tasks can be scattered thoughts or just a few words when you’re brainstorming. For example, late at night when you’re just about to call it a day, you realize you have to finish writing a memo and send to your boss and your client by tomorrow. With the revamped My Tasks II, just type = to launch My Tasks and type the tasks down and move on.    Adding personal tasks has become more intuitive with Quire. When you are working on different projects and you want to quickly make a note to self, you can use the hotkey m or click + on the upper right corner to add a task directly to My Tasks without leaving your current project.           Later,  you can go back to your own My Tasks and organize those cluttered tasks. The best part is, Quire infinite nested list is also enabled for personal tasks. You can create endless sub-levels for your tasks if necessary.      Organize your task list with Dynamic Sort and Filter      Tip: Use the filter `Project` and choose `None` to view your personal tasks only.  Before with the old version of My Tasks, it was just a sad plain list on the upper left corner to look at. And we don’t want you to start your day with a sad list. The newly revamped My Tasks II lets you have a more reliable and dynamic list to kickstart your day.    Along with the new My Tasks II, we also introduced two brand new sorting and filtering options: Sort by Project and Filter by Project. You can now see your task lists being grouped neatly into specific categories. Also, in case you’ve missed it, recently we also have the new two-level sorting option so that you can be creative with all of the sorting and filtering.      Tip: Be creative with Quire Dynamic Sort and Filter! You can sort your task list by `Date` then `Project` and filter by `Priority`. Voila! You can also bookmark this filter for future use as well.  The best news is, with Quire users’ suggestions and feedback, we have added the task hierarchy function to My Tasks II. All of the tasks in My Tasks now share the same hierarchical layout with the project task list. Moreover, you can keep your task list in order by rearranging the tasks intuitively with drag-and-drop function whenever you need.      Many Quireans told us how they love the old 3-panel view for My Task. It’s always a breeze to click a task on My Tasks and view the project respectively in the main panel. With the new My Tasks II, navigation cannot get any more simple. You can simply right-click the task and choose Go to [Project] and the system will take you to the same task in the project. Then you can press = to go back to My Tasks and continue where you left off.    Collaborate and view project members’ progress.   When you are working on a complex project with a lot of team members, it’s easy to get lost in the information maze. Staying on track with your task list is one thing, keeping an eye on your team members’ progress can be very difficult.    With the new My Tasks II, you can click on the member’s profile and view their task lists (no worries, your personal tasks are still private to you only!). You can even use filter and sort to have a closer look at those tasks your team members are working on.    To make your workflow even more intuitive, you can create a new task in your team members’ My Tasks section to directly assign the task to them as well. Your team member will get the notification about the newly created task.    A smart to-do list that helps you get things done.   We rebuilt Quire My Tasks with the goal to help our users visualize the task lists, plan ahead for future projects and ultimately get things done. My Tasks II is carefully designed to improve your workflow and optimize productivity. It’s just the early day for My Tasks II (and Quire!) so there are endless possibilities for us to explore. We hope with this update, we can be a part of your successful story to achieve your dreams one day.

        "title": "Quire My Tasks II: Redesign the way you kickstart a day",
        "excerpt": "   Drum roll please! 🥁🥁🥁 Today we’re thrilled to introduce you with the brand-new renovated Quire My Tasks II. Now you can have your own Quire to-do list to keep track of all the tasks that are related to you.    My Tasks is a default task list in Quire. Before, you have to select a project before adding a task. However, with the newly redesigned My Tasks, you can directly add a task to Quire without being specific about the project. Just select Add to My Tasks or use the shortcut m and the newly created task will be added to My Tasks list instead of the project you are working on.    The new My Tasks allows you to capture your ideas and put them in an unorganized folder so that your mind wouldn’t be too occupied. You can go back to the list in the future to filter out and work on the cluttered tasks that previously caught your attention.   Also, we introduced a new short cut to launch and close My Tasks immediately no matter which project you&#39;re working on. Just hit = and voila, there you go.    What tasks will be included in My Tasks?   My Tasks will include tasks that are assigned to you, created by you without assignees with start or due dates in any project and your personal tasks. Those tasks can belong to a specific project or just be the personal tasks without being assigned to a project.    All of the tasks in My Tasks share the same hierarchical layout with the project task list. Moreover, you can keep your task list in order by rearranging the tasks intuitively with drag-and-drop function whenever you need.   For more information about the new My Tasks, please visit the Getting Started Tutorial.   How can I make the best out of the new My Tasks?   Quickly check out your personal to-do list at a glance   When it comes to project management, getting started is always the hardest part. It is too easy to get lost at the information maze and a lot task list. However, with the revamped My Tasks, you can view the tasks that are relevant to you only, and start from there.    A practical implementation of GTD Method   If you’re a diehard fan of GTD Method, you already know the first step of this phenomenon organizing method. Don’t think twice, just list everything out so you can stop feeling overwhelmed with all of the tasks and thoughts. Quire My Tasks II serves as a central Inbox section for you to dump your ideas to and later, you can go back to review the task list and transfer to relevant projects.           One of the best enhancements with Quire My Tasks is the ability to directly complete the task. If the task is just temporary or it’s your personal task, you don’t have to transfer it to another project, just work on the task in the My Tasks and complete it when you’re done.   Keep track of other team members’ workload   A lot of Quireans (yes, that’s you - Quire users!) have raised the attention to Quire Team about the ability of viewing the tasks of other colleagues in the same organization or project. With the new My Tasks, you can keep track of everyone’s progress by viewing their tasks list. As for a project manager, being able to know who is doing what is very critical in order to create a smooth and streamlined workflow.    That’s all for today! We hope you like the new My Tasks! Everything&#39;s coming together because of you and your support! Thank you for being a part of another milestone for Quire!

        "title": "Quire - Behind the Scenes: The Untold Stories",
        "excerpt": "   Back in 2014, a group of developers had been trying out hundreds of project management software solutions in order to solve the productivity puzzle but left unanswered. The main problem with common project management software is that it involves a very long list, which can backfire on the efficiency in the workplace.    Unwilling to settle for all the complexity, Quire was born as an answer to conquering a big project and achieving your dreams. Maybe you’re new to Quire or you’ve been a Quirean for a long time, we would like to share with you the journey of Quire.   Today we’re thrilled to bring you an interview with Tom - the creator of Quire.  As a serial entrepreneur and a software developer, Tom shares with us his insightful tips to deal with software complexity, how to boost team productivity, and more!    To get us started, could you share a bit about the background of Quire and what was going on in the market when Quire launched and what were the goals for differentiation?    We’re Potix Corporation - a privately held software company that owns and develops ZK framework - the leading Java Web framework.  Along with our journey, from collaboration with Fortune 500 companies down to small businesses, we’ve tried ourselves with a variety of project management software but left unsatisfied.    The common project management tool involves working with a long task list; the interrelationships of tasks are not presented visually nor logically. What’s worse is that we were forced to digest every detail in a project head on.  Therefore, dealing with a long list in the most logical way has been Quire’s philosophy ever since.      We created Quire to map out exactly how your mind works. When you face a challenging project, it can get overwhelming if you don’t know where to start. Quire is designed to break down big ideas to digestible tasks to help you get started step-by-step then achieve the goal eventually. Instead of a plain disorganized to-do list, we introduced an infinite nested task list. Users can use tasks and subtasks to create an endless mind map to illustrate the big picture of a project.    Then when a list grows a bit overwhelming,  we have Kanban board for users to move some of the crucial tasks to focus on for a short period of time. Our Kanban board mirrors exactly how a tangible whiteboard works. Everything is laid out neatly for users to track progress and effortlessly visualize the workflow. You can have different boards for different teams within the same project.        Given your industry experience, what have been the biggest shifts you’ve witnessed over the years in the productivity software space? Can you identify any trends or challenges Quire has had to stay ahead of to remain competitive?    There is always a new productivity software that comes out every now and then. Each software is developed with different approaches. Every productivity software tries to add as many features as possible to their software to deliver the “whole package” tool for users.    However, it’s never our intention to make Quire a software that can please everyone. There’s no perfect solution when it comes to a project management tool. If you don’t like a tool because it doesn’t fit your needs, just walk away and pick up another.   At Quire, we believe a good project management software is made for solving one’s problems, making the impossible missions possible. We don’t want to create a platform that drives our users crazy because of all the features maze.    Your time comes with a price tag, don’t waste your time on learning and using a complicated tool. Quire puts together all the fundamental features that a project manager needs to get things done, no more, no less. And the best part is, all of the powerful features are wrapped in the most intuitive and logical user interface.   AI &amp; IFTTT (or, more precisely, application-to-application) are the two features that we’re considering at this moment. We believe a project management software that integrates with AI &amp; IFTTT will expand the users’ working capacities and boost productivity of the team without increasing stress.     Quire offers a good list of features — from streamlined to-do lists and progress trackers to cross-device functionality. Is there an underlying tenet connecting all of your features that you think attracts and retains users? What’s your personal favorite aspect of Quire to tell users about?    Unlike other kinds of software, users from productivity software market know exactly what they’re looking for. Every team has a set of required features that they expect to see in a tool. User’s interface also plays a very important role in the decision making process for a software deployment.    While having all the powerful functionality to help users achieve high levels of productivity,  Quire still successfully keeps a clean and minimalist design, which gets a lot of praise among our users community.    Each of the features in Quire was developed carefully to the details just to give our users the most logical workflow to ease up the tension at work. One of my favorites is the recently released Peekaboo feature. We believe productivity is a continuous process, so in order to keep up with your dynamic workflow, you must not get stuck or burnt out with your long task list.    Quire Peekaboo feature lets you tuck away the tasks that cannot be completed right away for future exploration. So instead of worrying about what to do, you can dive in your task list and actually make progress everyday.     If you had to quantify the #1 benefit Quire delivers to users, what would it be (hours saved through better organization, streamlined workflows, higher productivity rates, ROI, all of the above)?    As a productivity software, of course, the most valuable benefit that Quire delivers to our users is the ability to get things done at the minimum effort. We try not to create another problem while solving an existing problem. Our users come to Quire with the hope of having a software to organize their work and boost productivity.    We think Quire does a very good job at streamlining users’ workflows and saving all of the wasted effort and time in worrying about the project. Instead, with Quire, you can go ahead and start working on your project right away.       Quire doesn’t aim for adding heavy features and becoming an all-in-one solution. However, when it comes to adding new features, how much of the internal development process and discussions are based around adapting to the newest trend and/or listening to user feedback?    One of the benefits of cloud-based project management software is the central management. We update our system every couple days to create a better experience for our users. Quire is a product-oriented company, which means we focus on how to actually enhance our product.    We have an active community and we receive a lot of feedback and suggestions from our users everyday. We spend a lot of time in listening to the needs of the users then discussing internally on how to best deliver the new feature. Creating a bunch of features isn’t an impossible mission, however, creating one feature that actually goes well with the existing workflow to become a whole package is another story.    In most cases, we spend more time on thinking about the logic behind a potential feature, than on the how-to implement it.  For example, mostly every productivity tool has Kanban board, but when we decided to add Kanban board to Quire, it took our team nearly 1 year to come up with a different approach that actually solves our users with their productivity problem (streamlining workflow from brain-storming, planning to executing via nested task list and Kanban board).   A lot of our users now really appreciate and love the way Quire allows them to have both of the views for one project instead of pushing them to choose either one.         What’s on the horizon? Is there anything coming down the pipeline that you’re personally excited about? Quire users are very excited to know about Quire roadmap.    We realize it’s impossible to fulfill every demand from our users and we never want to keep adding new irrelevant features to Quire just to have an all-in-one software. We decided to have Open APIs for our users to integrate their most preferable apps/software with Quire, and have a marketplace for our community to help each other to customize Quire.   Timeline, Gantt chart and IFTTT will soon come to Quire as well. We don’t want Quire to be “just another productivity software” with the same features, that’s why we take a lot of time in internal discussion and beta test to make sure the new feature will be a breakthrough and go smoothly with the current workflow in Quire.   Besides adding new features to Quire, we also keep reconsidering and refining the existing functionality for better user’s experience. For example, we’re working on the 3rd generation of “My Tasks” section. We hope the new updates can bring user’s productivity to another level.    Describe your team — is there a company ideology you’re most proud of, or perhaps, a little-known fact about your team culture/office dynamics that you think contributes to your success as a brand?    Quire is a very dynamic team. We have a very talented developer team with strong knowledge of technology. We always encourage our team members to think outside of the box and come up with new innovative ideas for Quire. We frequently discuss about users’ suggestions and how to enhance Quire.    Every member is inspired to actively use a lot of different tools and share our experiences with the team. We avoid viewing things as Quire developers, instead, our team always tries to walk on users’ shoes. We learn from our users, listen to the market’s needs and work as a team to deliver value to our community. Users’ positive feedback and suggestions are always the endless inspiration for us to develop Quire.  ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Start Your Dreams on Mars",
        "excerpt": "   Exploring Mars is no longer just a wild dream to human beings anymore. Team Tumbleweed is a group of currently 16 students that is building a wind-driven Mars rover. The team is located at TU Delft in the Netherlands, TU Wien in Austria, and at Stanford University in the US.    The idea is to develop a scouting solution that is able to rapidly explore large areas of Mars’ surface to identify research targets and find landing spots. Tumbleweed is a good mix of engineers, software developers, PR strategists, and business students. The team is currently growing from the core team of 4 people to hopefully around 50 in November 2019.   After several months of using Quire, the team loves to share with us how Quire has supported the whole team in managing their projects and collaborate with the team members from all over the globe.   An Excel File is No Longer Viable for a Dynamic Team Anymore   As the large remote team is coming together in a short time, Tumbleweed immediately faced a challenge with tracking their task list using Excel. The old-fashioned tool like Excel cannot be enough for a dynamic team and soon appeared to be not viable anymore. The team needs a new solution with rather basic functionality and good usability to manage their growing task lists.       Productivity software is such a crowded market and finding an one-size-fits-all solution is simply a mission impossible. Team Tumbleweed has googled for the best task management software and tried several popular solutions such as Trello or Meisertask before they settled for Quire.    “We used another popular solution for some time but no one really liked it since it forces you to put things on boards and people also were too lazy to look into it often.” -- Tumbleweed Team    Quire Provides the Exact Features that Our Team Needs - No More, No Less   After a short time of initial trial with Quire, Tumbleweed decides to settle with Quire. “[Quire] is the only free tool that had this “premium” feel to it and wasn’t overloaded with features we didn’t need,&#39;&#39; said Tumbleweed Team.   As one of the core values that Quire team shares when we started to develop Quire, trying to please everyone by stuffing as many features as possible into a project management software won’t do any good for a team. Instead of driving users crazy with the features maze, Quire focuses on creating the set of features that can go well with the existing workflow and deliver a whole package solution that can actually help users to get things done.   Team Tumbleweed also shared with Quire how they love the modern and minimal interface of this tool - just like a clean, well-organized sheet of paper lays out all the information you need. The main panel shows very clearly who to do what and when to meet the deadlines. It is critical for team collaboration to view and track what the other teammates are working on at the moment.       Since Mars exploration is obviously a big project that requires all hands on deck, communication can be very challenging and might backfire on the productivity if not handled carefully. Team Tumbleweed took advantage of Quire nested task list to break down the whole project to digestible tasks, organize in a well-structured hierarchical list, and keep everyone informed with the seamless Slack and Quire integration.     “Thank you so much for your work! We have already recommended it to other student groups. Please stick to your philosophy of providing only the most essential features but making those as easy to use as possible. You’re amazing!” -- Tumbleweed Team    Quire also allows Team Tumbleweed to keep documents corresponding to a task centralized using Google Drive integration. You just need to log in to Quire, find everything in one central place and waste no time since you never have to search for the deliverables.   Choosing a good project management software that has enough features for the team to get things done yet still maintain a simple and clean minimalist is not an easy mission. Quire team is very happy to join the exciting journey of Team Tumbleweed.  And, we aspire to hear more great stories about Quire’s role in pursuing your next goals!     ",

        "title": "Be a Hero: Create Your Own App with Quire API",
        "excerpt": "   We are happy to announce the release of version 1.0.0 of our OpenAPI, Quire uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate requests between your app and your users. With OAuth, users can give you access to their Quire content without giving up their passwords.    This means that a user could authorize an app to access data or make changes to their Quire account and services that are exposed by the Quire API. For example, an app could create or delete tasks, post a comment, or alter an assignee, due, tags.   OAuth Application Setup   In order to use Quire API, you’ll need to create an Oauth app.   Create your Quire oauth app   You’ll need to be logged in to your Quire account to create an app.    Go to the Quire developer app console and click on the Create new app button.   Choose the Quire Organization that your app belongs to, the organization members can view/edit all apps belongs to the selected organization.   Give your application a name and Redirect URL, we will discuss the role of the Redirect URL later. For now you can supply the following URL:   http://localhost:3000/callback  Click the Create new app button, your newly created OAuth application will be presented on the developer console page, allowing you to further configure it.     In summary, you should have these three bits of information:    Development Client ID: :wJoMEodI4fSSR54pfNwIuIzLnaJ Development Client Secret: eb8faf4nyd1wbeconw060e9ejui8zg6w8p1hyoex Callback URL: http://localhost:3000/callback      Setup Your Development Environment   Step 1. Configure Your App   Host your application configuration information in you app.    const clientId = &#39;:wJoMEodI4fSSR54pfNwIuIzLnaJ&#39;; const clientSecret = &#39;eb8faf4nyd1wbeconw060e9ejui8zg6w8p1hyoex&#39;; const redirectURI = &#39;http://localhost:3000/callback&#39;;    const authorizationUrl = &#39;https://quire.io/oauth&#39;; const tokenUrl = &#39;https://quire.io/oauth/token&#39;; const apiUrl = &#39;https://quire.io/api&#39;;  Step 2. Redirect User to Authorize App on Quire   Generate an authorization url that you will redirect your users to Quire’s OAuth endpoint URI. This will show a web page where logged in Quire users can authorize your application to access their content.   Sample URL:    https://quire.io/oauth?client_id=your-client-ID&amp;redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri  An authorization link view example might look like:   var http = require(&#39;http&#39;); var url = require(&#39;url&#39;); var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {      var uri = url.parse(req.url, true);     if (uri.pathname == &#39;/&#39;) {                 //..         } else if (uri.pathname == &quot;/install&quot;) {         var authUrl = authorizationUrl              + &#39;?client_id=&#39; + clientId              + &#39;&amp;redirect_uri=&#39; + encodeURIComponent(redirectURI);         res.writeHead(200, { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/html&#39; });         res.write(              &#39;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#39;              + &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39; + authUrl + &#39;&quot;&gt;Connect Quire&lt;/a&gt;&#39;           + &#39;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;);         res.end();      } else if (uri.pathname == &quot;/callback&quot;) {         //...     } }); server.listen(3000);  The state parameter is a random string used to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. You should randomly generate a character string. It will be passed back to your app, unchanged, in Step 3. Your application should validate this value. Though it is optional, we strongly recommend including this parameter.   Sample URL:    https://quire.io/oauth?client_id=your-client-ID&amp;redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri&amp;state=lpcl9v94z  Step 3. Handle the OAuth 2.0 server response   The OAuth 2.0 server responds to your application&#39;s access request by using the URL specified in the redirect_uri.   If the user approves the access request, then the response contains an authorization code. If the user does not approve the request, the response contains an error message. The authorization code or error message that is returned to the web server appears on the query string, as shown below:   An error response:   http://localhost:3000/callback?error=access_denied  An authorization code response:   http://localhost:3000/callback?code=4/P7q7W91a-oMsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7  A callback example might look like:   //... } else if (uri.pathname == &quot;/callback&quot;) {    var result = uri.query;    var message = &#39;Auth fail&#39;;    if (result[&quot;error_description&quot;] != null) {        message = result[&quot;error_description&quot;];        if (result[&quot;error&quot;] == &#39;access_denied&#39;) {            //display reject message        }        messageView(res, message);    } else if (result[&quot;code&quot;] != null) {        return exchangeAccessToken(result[&quot;code&quot;])        .then(function(data) {             var token = data[&#39;access_token&#39;];             message = token != null ? &#39;Success&#39;: &#39;Fail&#39;;             messageView(res, message);         });    } }  When the user is redirected back to your application redirect_uri, a code and state parameter will also be present in the querystring parameters. The state is your CSRF anti-forgery token to validate the request.   Extract the code and state from the query string parameters. The state may be validated at this point.   A validate example might look like:   } else if (result[&quot;code&quot;] != null) {     if (result[&quot;state&quot;] != stateFromSession(res))         return messageView(res, &#39;invalid state&#39;);                  return exchangeAccessToken(result[&quot;code&quot;])     .then(function(data) {          var token = data[&#39;access_token&#39;];          message = token != null ? &#39;Success&#39;: &#39;Fail&#39;;          messageView(res, message);      }); }  Step 4. Exchange authorization code for access token   Your application needs to make a POST call to the token endpoint with the extracted authorization code and the request parameters in the below.     Parameter Value    grant_type authorization_code   code {your-authorization-code}   client_id {your-client-ID}   client_secret {your-client-secret}    A request an access token example might look like this:   var request = require(&#39;request&#39;); function exchangeAccessToken(code) {     return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){         request.post({             url: tokenUrl,              form: {               grant_type: &#39;authorization_code&#39;,               code: code,               client_id: clientId,               client_secret: clientSecret             }           },            function (error, httpResponse, body) {             if (error) {               return reject(error);             }             resolve(JSON.parse(body))           });     }); }  The access token you receive in response will be a JSON format.    Example Response:   {    &quot;access_token&quot;:&quot;ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,    &quot;token_type&quot;: &quot;bearer&quot;,    &quot;expires_in&quot;:2592000,    &quot;refresh_token&quot;:&quot;REFRESH_TOKEN&quot; }  The token should be kept carefully and permanently since you need it to access every Quire API.   Make calls to the API using the access token   Your app now has an access token that it can be used to make API calls on user&#39;s behalf.   Call the API   Make the API call passing the access token as a bearer token in the header of the request.    An api call example might look like:   function getCurrentUser(token) {     return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){         request.get({             url: apiUrl + &#39;/user/id/me&#39;,              headers: {               &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer &quot; + token             }           },            function (error, httpResponse, body) {             if (error) {               return reject(error);             }             resolve(JSON.parse(body))           });     }); }  Example Response:   {   &quot;email&quot;: &quot;john@gmail.cc&quot;,   &quot;website&quot;: &quot;https://coolwebsites.com&quot;,   &quot;id&quot;: &quot;My_ID&quot;,   &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is *cool*!&quot;,   &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://quire.io/u/My_ID&quot;,   &quot;nameText&quot;: &quot;My Name&quot;,   &quot;nameHtml&quot;: &quot;My Name&quot;,   &quot;descriptionText&quot;: &quot;This is cool!&quot;,   &quot;descriptionHtml&quot;: &quot;This is &lt;i&gt;cool&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;,   &quot;image&quot;: &quot;https://quire.s3.amazonaws.com/oid/image.jpg&quot;,   &quot;iconColor&quot;: &quot;37&quot;,   &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My Name&quot;,   &quot;oid&quot;: &quot;Dyh2YkFcu9uLgLFIeN1kB4Ld&quot; }  Refreshing Tokens   An access token intentionally is meant for short-term use only. This is an important security mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow, the access tokens have an one-hour lifetime by default.   When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned:   {    code: 401,    message: &#39;Invalid or expired token.&#39;  }  Your application will need to refresh the access token.  function refreshToken(refreshToken) {     return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){         request.post({             url: tokenUrl,              form: {               grant_type: &#39;refresh_token&#39;,               refresh_token: refreshToken,               client_id: clientId,               client_secret: clientSecret             }           },            function (error, httpResponse, body) {             if (error) {               return reject(error);             }             resolve(JSON.parse(body))           });     }); }  Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication flow.    We hope by now you already know how to use Quire API! We can&#39;t wait to see the amazing apps that you will build for Quire! 😍  ",

        "title": "8 Best Tips for Remote Teams to Boost Productivity at Virtual Office",
        "excerpt": "   We are living in a fast-paced society where everything needs to be done quickly without any hassles. Nothing kills joy and productivity more than being chained to a desk for 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. Managers have found a better way to boost productivity and save infrastructure cost by supporting remote work for full-time employees. According to OwlLabs research, “companies that offer remote-friendly options see 25% less turnover than those who do not.”   Employees are happier when they can choose to work from home or at a rustic coffee shop, no matter if they are night owls or early birds, they have different options to make the schedule work best for their creativity and productivity.    Though it is inevitable that remote teams can deliver many benefits for companies overall, it still remains as a challenge for managers to ensure productivity for the whole team. Given the fact that each team member has a very different work schedule, team collaboration can suffer if not being handled carefully.    We have put together some tips to help entrepreneurs manage high-performing and productive remote teams.    1.  Adopt an effective collaboration tool   It is critical for the whole team to have a platform to share the work and collaborate together other than using email loops and messaging. One of the top challenges for remote teams is to keep track of the progress and streamline workflow with the time and location differences.  A cloud-based project management software is a perfect option to help teams coordinate and collaborate. Everything is laid out neatly within a single platform where anyone can access and be in sync with the whole team.    2. Set a clear agenda   One of the worst nightmares for remote team collaboration is to get lost in the information loop, especially if you are dealing with an international team who speak different languages. Important messages can be easily lost in translation. As an entrepreneur or manager, you should set a clear objective for each project and create different milestones so that your team can easily check in and track the progress.    3. Digitize the workflow   Not only you need a good project management software to keep everyone on the same page, you should digitize every communication channel or file storage system as well. There are tons of productivity apps that guarantee to actually make differences to teamwork efficiency.  By making every information available and accessible with an internet connection, you have saved hundreds of hours for the team to find the note sticking somewhere on the desk or arguing about the project deadlines.    4. Schedule conference calls and video-based coaching regularly   The perk of being a virtual employee is to have a relaxing working environment, but sometimes it can backfire on the productivity. It is very easy to get lost and mess up the whole plan when you cannot run into your supervisor’s office anytime to ask questions or just turn the chair around to discuss with your teammates. Many remote teams swear by a  good video conference app to enhance their face-to-face communication. Just schedule a weekly or monthly call, get everyone join the session from anywhere and discuss the projects. Even 10 - 15 minutes can make a huge impact on the team productivity.       5. Build the trust among team members   Some people have trust issues, it is completely understandable. But an entrepreneur that wants to embrace a remote workforce cannot have trust issues. There is always uncertainty about whether or not your team members are working or they are actually lying in Hawaii with a glass of Maitai on a Wednesday afternoon. Some remotely working guidelines should be established, such as standard response time, time-tracking tasks, regular updates and reports, etc.    6. Have time for 1:1 review session   It is difficult to manage a team that locates literally everywhere in the world. A company that supports work-from-home culture should really take feedback seriously in order to establish close bonds between team members and provide guidance when needed. Managers should schedule periodical 1:1 review session with the team members (the meeting can be easily conducted with a conference call app) to learn about the concerns or suggestions that might fly under manager radar or give out support when necessary.   7. Data analysis is the key   If you are managing a remote team, chances are sometimes you will find it very challenging to evaluate the workforce performance. Without the face-to-face conversation, monitoring employees’ productivity can be quite tricky. To get deeper insight into worker efficiency, data analysis can help you spot which projects need immediate attention or which employees may need some extra coaching effort.  You can also share the data analysis with the team so that everyone learns more about their productivity and how to improve if necessary.   8. Remove the remote once in a while   Working remotely can sometimes make employees feel isolated. Once in a while, you should get the whole team together and spend quality time to share the work experiences or just having face-to-face conversations. Team collaboration can be greatly benefited with some interactions among team members. It helps build strong relationships, create trust among workers, boost productivity and enhance team adaptation.    Remote team becomes a trend that a lot of enterprises embrace in order to expand their international market. A remote team can be an invaluable asset to the whole company. However, if managers fail to handle the working remotely culture, productivity can suffer and might result in revenue lost. Managers should be the one who glued the team together, and with the above tips, remotely working should be a very relaxing experience.   ",

        "title": "Busy vs. Productive: 5 Tips to Improve Time Management Skills for Project Managers",
        "excerpt": "   2019 has already come down to the last quarter, which means many of you have been busier than ever with all of the annual reports. Regardless of how many extra hours you’ve put in, the to-do list still appears to be never-ending. You started to wonder why you’re always busy but it doesn’t look like you’re being productive at work.    Everyone has the same amount of time every day - the same 24 hours no matter who you are and what you’re doing for a living - you have exactly 24 hours, no more no less. However, many people still complain about “having too much on my plate” but “so little time to do anything” while others seem to successfully optimize their schedule to make the most of every day.    The answer is “time management” skill. You don’t have to work overtime everyday or pull an allnighter every now and then to be productive. Many people only work for exact 8 hours per day and still meet the deadlines. We’ve put together some proven simple tips for you to follow in order to stop being busy and start being productive.    1. Schedule your to do list   Pre-loading your day with a good to-do list and a calendar works like a charm. Start your day with a task that is easy and enjoyable. No one asks you to move a mountain on a Monday morning, and you shouldn’t ask yourself the same thing. Write down everything you need to accomplish for one week then break down into several digestible to-do lists.    You can integrate your task list to Google Calendar to view what you have to do in a day so that you can get yourself well-prepared. Block off the most productive time in your calendar for some important tasks. No matter what happens, you should always stick to the as-planned schedule.    2. Set priorities for each task   Prioritizing is very important when it comes to agile project management. However, a task list with every task being labeled as “high priority” can backfire on your productivity. If you have too many things on your plate, group them by due dates first then start categorizing the priority level from there.    The tasks with the highest priority should always be pinned to the top of the task list. Even if you think every task is equally important, start with the one that holds the biggest consequence if you don’t complete it. Instead of being freaked out at the long list, just pick up a task and you will get more done eventually.       3. Eliminate distractions   If you’re terrible at being focused on your work, maybe you can get some help from a productivity app. You can set a reminder on your phone to tell you when to start working on a task, when to take a break or when the task is due.    The Pomodoro is a good time management technique that you should know. You will get a 25-minute interval to get focused and work on your tasks, followed by a 5-minute break. During the “focus state”, you cannot do anything but focus on your tasks without any hassle.   4. Track progress   One of the key tips to time management is to consistently track your progress. Trust your hunch when you feel like you haven’t accomplished anything, you’re probably right. Check your task list to see if you’ve made any progress recently.    It’s human nature to have limited self-control, but procrastination can be overcome when you do a daily productivity review. If you’re not sure how to track your work, maybe a project management software or a task management app can help you.   5. Set some boundaries   Don’t try to be a superhero and squeeze everything into a tight schedule. Excellent time management skills don’t require you to stress yourself out to overwork. Instead, you should get things done effectively and be productive while still maintaining a good mental health.   When you think you’re already overloaded with your to do list, start saying no to the irrelevant tasks. You’re given with that much time, don’t sacrifice your sanity with a never-ending list. Take time out, get rest, have a life outside your office, etc. A good project manager is the one that knows how to balance between life and job, not a workaholic who is busy all the time.   ",

        "title": "3 Proven Tips on How to Run Effective Meetings with a Digital To Do List",
        "excerpt": "   You may want to ask yourself these two questions: “How much time do I spend on meetings this week?” and “Are my business meetings effective?” If you think those meetings suck and they’re wasting your time, well, you’re not alone.    According to a research on Harvard Business Review about quantifying the actual cost of meetings to your company, due to the ripple effect, one weekly meeting accounts for 7,000 hours a year and a company will spend approximately total 300,000 hours a year on just meetings only.    Time is money, but there is no money can buy back the time that you’ve spent. Moreover, the abundance of pointless and dreadful meetings will leave negative feelings among all of the employees, not to mention the unnecessary confusion that it may create after the meetings.   It’s time to stop the meeting madness and seek for improvement from another angle: use a project management software or to do list app as a tool to combat dreadful meetings instead of the traditional approach. We’ve put together some tips for running effective meetings for you.   Tip #1: Set a clear objective      An efficient meeting must serve a defined and specific goal. You cannot invite people over and waste their time for nothing.  Setting a clear objective for the meeting can also help you track progress and its efficiency.    The New York Times has pointed out that “the agenda provides a compass for the conversation”, so if you don’t want the attendees to leave the meeting without a clue about what just happened, it might be best to clearly state the meeting’s objective in the invitation before sending it out.       You can prepare a to do list that contains every topic that you want to cover as a meeting agenda. Be as specific as possible and keep everything simple and straight to the point. With your list, try to add details or attach attachments to the item that requires to be discussed further.   Tip #2: Stick to the schedule and get focused      Nothing is more annoying than being in a meeting that is dragged longer than expected and everything seems irrelevant.  Given the to do list that has been prepared beforehand, the meeting should be held accordingly to each task on the list and avoid the impromptu discussion that might destroy the agenda.    Taking notes during the meeting can be just as important. If a task is time-sensitive, add start dates and due dates in order to track the schedule and control the deadlines in the future. Get creative with your task list, for example, you can add tags to each task for better management or directly cue the responsible personnel by assigning the task to them.       It is very easy to doze off and get distracted with the long list, especially during a several-hour meeting. If you never heard of Kanban board, now is a good time to learn more about this magical board. Kanban board provides a focused zone where you and your team can get focused on a few crucial tasks for a short period of time.    Tip #3: Follow up      No matter if it is a virtual meeting or a monthly board meeting, follow up is the key to keep track with what will happen after the meeting. To reduce the risk of pointless meetings, managers can check the reports to view the progress of a project at anytime and leave comments when necessary.    Don’t wait until the next meeting to ask for the progress. Check in with the team members or person-in-charge frequently to evaluate the whole project’s progress. Communication is the key to team collaboration. Sometimes, making adjustments and planning ahead of time are very important to ensure the task is underway.   Stop wasting your life on the meeting madness.   We spend at least 8 hours/day at work, that accounts for one-third of your time for a day. Stop wasting your precious time on the meetings that only suck the life out of you. A good to do list may not be enough to run an effective meeting, however, it’s a good start. Furthermore, if you use a collaboration or project management tool, you can even avoid certain kinds of meetings, the ones that only need to be held for progress tracking. Time is money, don’t waste your company’s tremendous resources on pointless meetings.   ",

        "title": "7 Productivity Tips to Avoid Burnout at Work",
        "excerpt": "   Admit this, everyone has a breaking point at work. No matter how much you love your job or enjoy working with your teammates, there will be times that exhaustion and stress prevail then a sense of defeat sets in. It’s no one’s fault, you have the right to feel unmotivated and drained from time to time.     On May 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified burnout as a legitimate “occupational phenomenon” mental syndrome. The constant stress, negative feelings, physical and emotional fatigue at work has now become a serious problem that threatens job performance and costs your business. In the long run, burnout can cause depression among employees and have some severe effect on mental health.     “It’s better to prepare and prevent than it is to repair and repent.” - Ezra Taft Benson    When realizing some burnout symptoms,  you can start making some adjustments to the way you’re doing your job. Here are some proven effective tips to avoid getting burned out at workplace.    Tip #1: Acknowledge your breaking point.   Even though you’re a chronic workaholic, you should set your own boundaries. Being an overachiever can cost you your productivity in the long run. Responsibility can create stress and wear you down if you are taking on more than your capacity. Overwhelming workload has also been proven to create nervous breakdown and physical fatigue.    It’s not easy to say “no”, at first. However, if you want to stay focused and energetic, you have to slow down and choose your tasks wisely. There’s no point in trying to be a superhero at work while it does nothing other than draining your own energy and taking away your excitement.    Tip #2: Create an effective to do list and commit to it.   We are almost 20 years into the twenty-first century, it’s not surprising if your productivity suffers because you still plan things in your head and try to remember every single to-dos without making a physical list. There are hundreds of to do list apps that you can choose from beside paper and pen.    A good to do list app can help you consolidate all of your tasks in one place. You should be very specific and organized with your list in order to commit to the list easier. You can set priorities, track your progress and carry out your tasks in a timely manner. With an effective and practical to do list, you can get more done instead of worrying if you’ve missed one or two tasks.    Moreover, planning ahead can help you reduce unnecessary stress and evaluate your workload. If you experience exhaustion with your to do list, maybe it’s a good time to unplug some of the tasks in the list.    Tip #3: Deploy a good productivity method.   If you’re a procrastinator who always get stressed out because of your own to do list, it’s critical for you to commit to a productivity method. One of the most common productivity methods that thousands of project managers swear by is Getting Things Done (GTD) by David Allen. With GTD method, you can plan out each step in advance in order to reduce unnecessary stress.    You can integrate the GTD method with your preferable project management app to get more done. By consistently working on single to-do until you’ve checked off all the tasks in the list, you will not be stressed out by all of the distractions.     Tip #4: Practice KonMari Method at work.   Marie Kondo is a guru when it comes to decluttering and cleaning method. You may have heard of the word “spark joy” over and over again and you’ve successfully KonMari’d your house and your closet. But how about your work and your task list?    The core value of the phenomenal KonMari method is to deliberately and mindfully choose the things that you want to keep in your life. You should start with your workspace by decluttering your folder cabinet and digital mailbox. An inbox filled with emails can trigger stress and emotional burnout in the long run, so it’s better for your mental health that you have a working system that helps you declutter those physical and emotional distractions.    Tip #5: Meditate or work out.   Taking breaks and doing some stretching exercises once in a while during work hours can really help you relieve stress and anxiety. You can also practice meditation at least twice a week to flush out toxins and gain positive energy.    Sitting at your desk for long hours can create physical pain and emotional exhaustion that cause burnout. Stop your mind from worrying about your job and start doing some simple exercises.    Tip #6: Ask if you need help.   There’s no shame to ask for help from others - it will not make people think less of you. Remember no one can be good at everything and sometimes team collaboration is the key to a business’ success.    Choose a good collaborative platform or tool to enhance team performance and optimize the workflow. If you want to prevent burnout, let the stress out before it builds up and backfires on your work productivity.    Tip #7: If nothing works, take time out.   If you’ve done everything in the list and you still feel exhausted and stressed, maybe it’s a good time to take a step back and have a break for yourself.  You’ve done everything you could to deal with burnout at work but now the pressure officially exceeds your ability to cope. It’s okay to take time out.    Rome wasn’t built in one day, so is your career path. You will achieve all of your goals and your dreams eventually, it’s nothing wrong with putting yourself first and taking care of your health for now.    Burnout is an epidemic in the working culture and it has to be taken seriously. Preventing burnout at work doesn’t have to be rocket science. You can just follow the above simple steps to improve job performance without overloading your stress level.    Relax, the world will still be there tomorrow! G&#39;luck! 😊  ",

        "title": "Set Up GTD Method in Quire to Live a Stress-free Life",
        "excerpt": "   Almost two decades after the best-selling book by David Allen first published, Getting Things Done (GTD) still remains to be one of the most popular productivity methods that is trusted by thousands of project managers.    Let’s face it - everyone is procrastinators! At least once in your life, you postpone something for later and soon regret that decision. No worries, we’re all the same here. When GTD method is first introduced to the public, it immediately became the phenomenal productivity hack that a lot of people swear by. The core value of GTD method is that instead of worrying about the tasks you should have done, it encourages you to actually get things done.   r/explainlikeimfive: What is GTD method?   The GTD method is a way to organize, categorize, plan and execute your tasks. Many people discussed and argued whether GTD methodology is really efficient given its complexity. However, as straightforward as it is, GTD is set up to help you answer one question “When to do what?”.    You’re in charge of choosing which task to be worked on first and which task to be put aside for later. With GTD method, you can plan out each step in advance in order to reduce unnecessary stress. You don’t have too much information in your mind anymore, you can start with a clean slate and working on your job instead of thinking about what you have to do.   The GTD method lays out 5 steps to achieve your goal without stressing yourself out.        Capture: Write down everything in your mind, every task you have to do. Don’t think twice, just list everything out. Clarify: Process the list and decide which task should be done first or required immediate attention. Organize: Add due dates, delegate for others, build a reference file, etc. Basically, you put everything to where they belong to. Review: Review your task list frequently to see if it needs to be updated or revised. Engage: Start doing!   Now you already have an idea of how GTD method works, let’s go to the next step (the best step) to see how Quire comes in to rescue you from the tension of having too much to do and not knowing where to start.       Aligning Quire with GTD Method   Being a rising star among the best project management software, Quire lets you achieve your dreams by breaking them down into small doable tasks then work toward your goal. Sounds familiar? Quire shares the core value with GTD in terms of not pushing users to the edge with overwhelming goals, instead you should consistently work on your to-dos then eventually one day, you’ll finish what you’ve started.   No matter if you’re a new to Quire or you’ve been a Quire diehard fan for years, chances are you haven’t thought of implementing GTD method into Quire (if you have done that already, kudos to you! 😆).    Though David Allen introduced GTD method to be worked with pen and paper, along with the development of modern society, everyone is trying to find the best way to implement GTD to digital lifestyle. We have put together several features of Quire that can be aligned perfectly with 5 steps of GTD method.    Step 1 - Capture: Nested task list      The first rule of GTD method is to have a blank mind and a clean plate. With Quire My Tasks, you can dump all of your tangled thoughts and put them into a list. Quire My Tasks lets you have an infinite list to store your cluttered tasks. Later you can come back and revisit your personal task list so that you can transfer or start working on them then complete the task list altogether.   Step 2 - Clarify: Add assignees, descriptions, transfer, comments      GTD asks you one question here: “Is this task actionable now?”. If yes, the next question would be “Would it take less than 2 minutes to complete the task”. If it does, then you have to do it right away.    If the tasks require more than 2 actions to finish, you might have to transfer them into a new list. At Quire, you can easily move a group of tasks from one project to another in just seconds. And if you bookmark the new project, you can easily switch between projects to keep track of everything.   If you’re not the one who will be responsible for the tasks, you can delegate them for others. Quire lets you assign the task to one or more assignees, even to a team!    Step 3 - Organize: Add tags, Due dates, Priority, Peekaboo      David Allen suggests to categorize all of the actionable tasks at this step. The key here is to put the right thing to the right place. Luckily with Quire, we have Peekaboo, Due dates and Tags features to let you fulfill this step.     🔖 Read more about how to peekaboo a task to tuck away the distractions   The golden rule of thumb for this step is to well-manage your list. Never underestimate how a plain and disorganized to do list can destroy your productivity, GTD method lets you go through your list and put more contexts to the list for better management.    Quire lets you assign tags, due and start dates and priority to a task. With all the details, you can have the big picture of your project and effortlessly track the progress.   If you want to postpone the tasks for future exploration or you just want those tasks to serve as reference list only, Quire Peekaboo feature lets you to tuck away all of the distractions so that you can focus only on the things that need your immediate attention. The idea is to move forward with your task list, rather than getting stuck on a particular step.   Step 4 - Reflect: Overview, Report      It is critical for a GTD practitioner to reflect on the progress and make the changes accordingly. You have to review frequently to know how far you’re from the goal.   Luckily, Quire has made the reflect process easier than ever with the exceptional overview reports. This view includes charts, graphs, summaries and recent activities that show you how much has been done, how much needs to be done, etc.   You need to review your next action list (different projects), waiting for list (Peekaboo list), upcoming calendar (Calendar integration). If there are some tasks that are no longer relevant, delete them for a cleaner task list.   Step 5 - Engage: Kanban Board, My Task      No more procrastination! No more excuses! We hope at this step, you already know what you have to do now! Take action on your task list and achieve your dreams!    You can select several tasks that need your immediate attention and move them to Kanban board. By doing this, instead of looking at a long list (that sometimes may cause distraction), you can just focus on a flat board with all of the tasks that are beautifully laid out and ready to be worked on.    Quire Kanban board also provides swimlane view for you. Just sort all of your tasks by tags or due dates or assignees and voila, a swimlane is effortlessly created and ready to be dove in!    If you’re working on a project with multiple assignees and contributors, Quire My Task section will be very handy for you to view all of your tasks from different projects and organizations.    Is GTD Method a master key to open any door?   It’s undeniable that GTD is one of the best productivity methods. You have to be committed to every step of the way to actually get more done. GTD helps you maximize your resources allocation, clear your mind, focus on the important things only.    However, as we always say, there’s no perfect solution. Quire and GTD may be a powerful duo to help you boost your productivity and achieve your goals, but it’s also up to you and how you want to digest your task list. Let’s wrap up with a very cliche saying that everything is possible, you just need to find a suitable tool and a good method to get you started on your dream!      ",

        "title": "Quire Peekaboo and GTD Methodology: A Miracle for Your Productivity Hack",
        "excerpt": "   It&#39;s a Monday morning, you’re sitting at your desk trying to recover from your weekend while waiting for the morning caffeine to kick in. You are browsing your task list for the week and suddenly you feel defeated and discouraged by the never-ending list. Well, Monday doesn’t suck, you just don’t know how to organize your work yet. And we’re here to rescue you from the Monday blues.    Researchers have pointed out that incomplete tasks can trigger stress - especially at workplace. Trying to combat with an overwhelming list with thousands of unfinished to-dos can drain energy, make you lose motivation and get tired easily. Sometimes, listing out everything you need to do does more harm than good. Rather than trying to be an overachieving superhero, how about just be an ordinary person with an effective working method?       Years ago, when David Allen first introduced Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology in his book, it immediately became a phenomenon all over the world. Basically, GTD is a productivity method that helps you organize, optimize productivity, reduce stress and save your precious time. The key to GTD is an open loop that includes everything.    In contrast to the myth, GTD doesn’t aim to complete the tasks right away. Instead, the goal is to continuously work to accomplish daily goals and eventually, one day you will check off all of the tasks on the list.    Where do all the incomplete tasks go?      The idea of GTD methodology is to have a place for you to store all the tasks that are not required immediate attention and action. David Allen used the term “Someday/Maybe” for all the tasks that are impossible to move on at the present but you cannot ignore them completely. As you go through the tasks list, you can determine which tasks can be pushed back and revisited in the future.    At Quire, we realize it’s important to keep going forward with your goal instead of getting distracted or pressured by the unrelated tasks. We recently introduced a powerful feature that has the cutest name ever - Peekaboo. When your list grows a tad overwhelming, you can pick several tasks that are not actionable at the moment or can be worked on in the near future and peekaboo them, meaning moving to a separate folder that will not bother you anymore.    The peekaboo folder will remain inactive until you visit and pick up on the peekaboo-ed tasks that you want to start working on. We also allow you to set a specific time for the tasks to reshow on the active list so that you will not forget about their existence. The philosophy behind is that you still have to complete them eventually - just not now - so you can buy some more time to work on something more important.    It’s all about you and how you would like to digest your task list. You choose which tasks to keep and which tasks should be peekaboo-ed for future exploration. You decide when to pick up on what you’ve left off. You will get reminded about the tasks that you peekaboo-ed so you will never actually forget about them and miss the deadlines.    Peekaboo + Kanban Board + Nested Task List = Fantastic Three      Several years ago, we introduced Kanban board and you all love it. At that time, we explained Kanban board will help you focus and execute the assignments that matter the most at the moment while a nested task list is good for planning and brainstorming. You may ask, so what’s the difference between a Kanban board and Peekaboo folder?   Well, everything you know about Kanban board is correct! Basically, Kanban board is made for the tasks that require immediate action whilst Peekaboo folder is for the postponed tasks. You can think of a task that needs to be done someday, not today.  Sooner or later, you have to work on the tasks that you’ve peekaboo-ed, but not right now, not at this moment.    David Allen has explained why sometimes setting the pending status to a task can unleash the flow of your creative thinking. You don’t have to worry about too many things at once. Your mind capacity will not be overloaded. You can work on everything that goes smoothly and let the obstacles disappear for a while so it won’t bother you.    Let’s say you have a list of everything you need to do for a Charity Campaign.       There are several tasks that need to be worked on in the upcoming weeks, so you move them to a board.       There are several tasks that you have to do eventually, but not now, and you don’t want those tasks to distract you and your workflow.       So you can select those tasks and peekaboo them.   You can set the time for these tasks to reappear again on your list so you can get your attention to them. Or if those tasks are meant for reference only, you can just leave them in the peekaboo folder.    Peekaboo! Work hard but never forget to have fun!   We always hope Quire is not only a platform for you to organize your work and boost up the productivity, Quire should also be a tool to inspire you everyday!    Follow your passion, love your job and you will never have to work another day in your life! We hope you all have fun with Quire!

        "title": "Top 3 Productivity Tips With Online To Do List Software",
        "excerpt": "   In a fiercely competitive digital landscape, great project management is a vital skill for teams and individuals alike. Disorganization and inefficiency can devastate the most promising teams and projects.   There is certainly no shortage of project management tools offering solutions to this challenge. One such grouping of tools is generally referred to as online to do list software. To do list software primarily takes a checklist approach to task management and productivity.   Whether you’ve tried a to do list method, or are considering doing so, here are three crucial and interrelated tips to know about.   Online To Do List Software Productivity Tip #1: Be Specific   Break big projects and ideas into small tasks   New York Times bestseller Charles Duhigg said in his book The Most Effective Way to Create a To-Do List, “[We should] take a big ambition and break it into objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and with a Timeline.”   A to do list which is too generic can lead to scope creep, missed deadlines, and frustration. An overwhelming to do list causes more stress than a simple note with multiple bullet points.   Many of us can relate to the “Where do I start?” sensation of looking at generic to do list. Figuring out which tasks have priority and attempting to, mentally, break them down into a logical order of subtasks has a way of paralyzing productivity.         When task lists get out of control. Anyone else want to take another coffee break?  Besides wrecking productivity, the lack of specificity in a to do checklist can have the effect of making a disciplined and hardworking person feel like a procrastinator. What a rough way to start the day: feeling like a lazy person and wasting precious mental energy trying to wade through vague to do list tasks.   The secret is to break a project down into its smallest, most actionable parts. “Publish a book” is too vague, “Start writing chapter one” is more actionable.    To do lists which are too generic can lead to scope creep, missed deadlines, and frustration.    Online To Do List Software Productivity Tip #2: Prioritize and Filter   Stay sane by prioritizing and organizing to do list tasks   One potential pitfall of online to do list software is task overload. Checklists can become overwhelming and hinder productivity. The granularity is great, but the problem becomes the mountain of actionable tasks, this is the opposite problem of vague, generic tasks. When faced with a list of countless tasks, where should one even begin?   Become a productivity master with online to do list prioritizing, filtering and tagging   Nested to do list views are a wonderful way to capture actionable project tasks. A productive team will capture these requirements in great detail, but they won’t stop there. Team members need a way to make clear sense of the tasks. Great to do list software provides numerous, powerful ways to create clarity and organize. Look for a solution which incorporates the following features:    A view of today’s tasks only The ability to tag and filter tasks, so you can stay focused and leave out distractions Simple prioritization (ie: urgent, high, medium, low) The ability to assign a task to the people responsible for it, even if they are outside of your organization A powerful and instant search tool The ability to see tasks from multiple projects, all in one place   Software with sophisticated organizational controls enables you to manage tasks with precision, preventing to do list paralysis. Paired with customizable notifications and reminders, there’s a lot to love about the visual task hierarchy model.   Online To Do List Software Productivity Tip #3: Team Up   Collaborate and conquer   Rarely do tasks divide up neatly. Many modern technologists have overlapping skill sets and shared assignments. It’s a great idea to have shared task lists.   Perhaps a task like “Install Bootstrap” requires multiple team members. No problem, create a parent task “Install Bootstrap” and then dish out some relevant subtasks to your IT, Developers, and designers.   Not only is this an effective way to organize work, shared tasks tend to encourage team members and boost morale. Team members feel less isolated and are excited to help achieve a common goal. Who doesn’t like to see awesome coworkers checking off progress on an ambitious requirement?         Quire uses live updates, so team members can see comments and modifications instantly. Every task supports comments, attachments, duplication, and even merging so you can spend your time achieving big ideas.  Besides team collaborations, there is often the need to collaborate with outside parties. At larger organizations, assigning tasks across departments or working with clients can be a real nightmare:    You: “Great meeting everyone. We have a clear list of action items, I’ll add them to our to do list software.” Stakeholder 1: “I’ve never heard of that software. Is it going to require me to sign up?” External client: “I don’t have that software.”   To solve scenarios like this, look for a to do list software which allows you to share tasks with external parties, including the ability to share a private or public project URL—without requiring sign ups.   Finally, to control access, grant different authorities to different members of your projects.         Share these online to do list tips or save them for future reference with this handy graphic.  Summary   At Quire, we think our project management solution has the right features to boost productivity and elegantly manage tasks. While it’s much more than an online to do list, we pride ourselves on providing all you need: no more, no less. We think you’ll love the simplicity, and find Quire intuitive and easy to use.  ",

        "title": "Quire Mobile 3.0: Kanban Board comes to Mobile App",
        "excerpt": "   Hello Quire squad, we have some great news for all of you! One of the long-awaited features that all of our users have been requesting has come to life. Today we are super excited that we have brought our famous Kanban Board to both Android and iOS App.                  We both know how you all love to use the nested task list to dump your ideas and organize them into a hierarchical order. Now Mobile users, you can get in motion and have a jumpstart with your project using Quire Kanban Board.    Why Kanban board?   If you’re a Quire Expert, you already know how Kanban Board helps you execute your project! And the ones who are new onboard, it’s okay, using our Kanban Board is just as easy as our nested task list!    The basic idea of Kanban board is to select several crucial tasks from your long nested list and move them to a board, so that for a short time you can get all of your attention to those specific tasks only. Since everything is laid straightforward in a board with columns, you can easily visualize your workflow.    Think of every task as a sticky note and your board as a blackboard - you can drag and drop to move the tasks across columns through every stage. You can also add new tasks to increase the workload and track the progress of what you have been doing.         Did you know that we also have “swimlane” in our Kanban board? No, it’s not the real swimlane. It’s the figurative flow that shows in Quire Kanban board by using either filter or sort feature. You can view related tasks in sorted order, which helps you focus more on what matters to you.    For example, you can choose “Sort by Assignee” to view all the tasks that are grouped by each assignee to get a hold of who is responsible for what.    Nested Task List Teams Up With Kanban Board          You may ask why you need both of the working modes, why not only task list or Kanban board like other project management solutions? At Quire, we believe the sky’s the limit as long as you break your challenging goal into attainable tasks and achieve them one-by-one.    Quire task list with the hierarchical structure allows you to brainstorm and plan ahead for your projects. On the other hand, Quire Kanban board is for execution and progress tracking. The best thing with Quire is, you can switch between nested task list and Kanban board at any time to get the best of both worlds.   We always wish to help everyone achieve their dreams. Don’t let anyone stop you from fulfilling your dream. We hope Quire can give you a little push to move closer to your dream 😃    Have fun and enjoy Quire! If you have something you want us to know, leave us a comment here or send us an email to feedback@quire.io. We’re all ears!   ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: How does a Silicon Valley NPO coordinate with 400 volunteers?",
        "excerpt": "   ZaiGeZaiGu (載歌在谷), or ZGZG in short, is a project of Community Builder Toolbox, Inc. - US IRS registered Non-profit Organization (NPO) and also a Chinese volunteer community which originates from Google at Mountain View, CA, in 2014.    They organize three events every year, Chinese New Year Gala (2500+ audiences, 100+ volunteers involved), Singing Contest (500+ audiences, 100+ volunteers involved), Chinese Culture Fair (1800+ visitors, 100+ volunteers involved).   Realizing that the volunteer project&#39;s scale and complexity have outgrown beyond a regular spreadsheet can track, ZGZG signed up for a Quire account with the hope to find a tool that helps them organize their tasks.    They share with us how ZGZG uses Quire to track tasks and boost productivity across their community.   When a simple spreadsheet is no longer enough for large scale task management   Starting with a volunteer community in Google, now ZGZG grows beyond Google employees and consists of 400+ high tech employees, university students, early tech company founders, etc. in the Silicon Valley.    As their organization keeps growing, “Google Sheets and Docs become harder and harder for us to do task tracking, even for those tech savvy volunteers who &quot;know Google Sheets from inside out&quot;, have felt the need of migrating from Sheets to a separate project management tool, such as Quire”, commented Victor Zhou.    Besides, their community needs to track which volunteer completed what kind of tasks so that they can give the corresponding benefits and reimbursements to them, as a reward system.   As ZGZG leaders were looking for an alternative to Google Sheets, they’ve tried many other solutions such as Jira, Pivotal, ClickUp, Monday or OpenProjects, however, “Jira is too complicated and the learning curve seems to be steep, whilst Google sheets is not designed for task tracking, though we can do that with the powerful AppScript integrated in sheets, but there are no guarantees in stability and customer service support.” stated ZGZG.          Simplicity is the answer when it comes to a good project management tool   There is no such thing as a perfect project management software. There is only the “right” one that can meet most of your needs and be the solution that helps you ease up your workload.    Since there are more than 400 volunteers across ZGZG community, implementing a new software can be a real challenge.   In the past, when ZGZG tried Jira, they have encountered resistance from their volunteers. “The most important reason why we are reluctant to use Jira is that several teammates once spent around 1 hour to learn Jira but still don’t know how to use it to track tasks,” said Sunny Song, a volunteer from ZGZG.    After volunteers recommend against Jira, ZGZG carefully examined another “more simple” project management software, and they found Quire on Google search with the key word “task tracking tool”.    After a short time of initial trial, ZGZG started to officially get their teams on board with Quire about 3 months ago.  And their team loved it.     “We adopted Quire in this quarter and really love its compact UI and layered-tasks management features.  Most tasks turn-around-time are very short. Quire has increased our productivity and made everything organized and easy to track.”  -- Victor Zhou and Sunny Song     There are some reasons that make Quire outweigh its competitors, and here is what ZGZG has to say about Quire.     Easy to use: It requires little to no effort to learn how to use Quire. The software is very straightforward, intuitive and lightweight. You don’t have to spend any of your budget on the learning cost. Also, onboarding new members cannot get any easier - just adding their emails and you can start collaborating with your teammates!  Completed features list: Quire enables users to customize the task list based on their needs. ZGZG loves tags, multiple assignees (this is the dealbreaker feature for ZGZG), layered tasks management, project duplication, filter, email notifications to assignees, task priority, task descriptions and comments.   Integration: Quire has the option to integrate with Slack, which ZGZG heavily uses on a daily basis.  Public view: Since ZGZG is thrive for transparency, they really appreciate that Quire project could be configured to be viewed publicly.   Cloud-based data storage: Since ZGZG’s volunteers are from many countries, it’s critical to have a secured platform to store all of their works. Say goodbye to those emails with attachments that easily get lost in your mailbox. Everything is done online and stored safely, you can work on your projects anytime anywhere.   Real-time collaboration: Quire allows ZGZG to interact with their volunteers quickly on live meetings.  Intuitive UX: From a tech savvy to a person who doesn’t know much about software, all fall in love with Quire&#39;s &quot;click to add a task&quot; simple UX flow without training.   Export to JSON: Availability to download all tasks in JSON helps ZGZG analyze their productivity afterwards.     “We ZGZG highly recommend Quire to any other volunteer-based projects and organizations like us.&quot;    It’s about time that every organization should realize that a conventional flat to-do list or a Google Sheet file does more harm than good to their productivity.    A project at work should not be treated as a laundry list for daily chores. Quire is an essential software to deal with project management by breaking down big ideas to small and achievable tasks.    We seek to bring you a stable and stress-free platform to keep track of your work. Everyone on your organization will be kept in the same loop. No more overdue projects or overwhelming to-do list.    ZGZG is such an inspirational example of how a simple project management software can drive your whole community to success. And, this is the reason why we developed Quire - to help you walk your dream home.   ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Making a Safer and Cleaner Space Environment",
        "excerpt": "   Space pollution is indeed a growing problem, but may not be so obvious or visible to people on earth. Alexandre de Villardi de Montlaur and his team are among scientists and engineers trying to solve this problem. Alexandre, coordinator of the most significant project, the ECE3SAT project at ECE Paris, shares with us on how Quire has supported his team in designing a deboriting satellite that seeks to resolve this growing issue.    Not so obvious, but persistent problem.   As more and more rockets are launched into the air, the accumulation of debris has increased over the years. And, we may not realize the catastrophic damage a tiny debris, smaller than a dime, could cause towards shuttles and the crew’s safety. It is a risk that is as dangerous as the failure of the shuttle’s main engine. And, “Currently, about 20,000 debris larger than a tennis ball and millions of debris, less than 1 cm, orbiting at 28,000 km/h [are present in space]” comments Alexandre. And, it definitely poses a threat not only to the “International Space Station (ISS) and telecommunications in orbit,” but also to the safety of our Astronauts.   Alexandre, senior, specializing in Aeronautical Embedded System at ECE Paris Graduate School of Engineering, aims at reducing the amount of debris floating in space and lessening the dangers it poses. And, he precisely depicts how Quire has aided the team considerably while implementing this deorbiting satellite.   Alexandre and his team of 30 have been delegated to develop 5 different modules that were significant to the design of the CubeSat. One module includes the ADCS, which controls the rotation and orientation of the satellite. Another is the EPS, the energy power supply, which uses sunlight as a source of energy. Then, there’s the OBC, an on-board computer that operates the coordination and communication within the satellite. And the TCS, which transmits data back and forth from Earth. As well as an EDT, an ElectroDynamic Tether performed by Alexandre himself, to help reduce the deorbiting time from years to months.     This unique deorbiting system and overall project is very complex, and encompasses many challenges to perform and implement. And, because this huge project consists of much planning, structuring and sharing relevant information, etc. it needs an efficient and intuitive tool. As Alexandre and his team browsed through the abundant resources available, they could not settle on any one of them because “all the sites [they] visited unnecessarily complicated the use of their sites for no reason” stated Alexandre and “it would take at least several hours to become completely familiar with the tools….”      “No one has much time to lose, time can be used on the benefits of the project…”  -- Alexandre de Villardi de Montlaur    Intuitive simplicity and the ergonomics of a nested list.   Without the proper tool to keep tasks straight, there were constant obstacles. However, after coming acquainted with Quire, they overcame barriers and proceeded with implementing their goal. Because of Quire’s user-friendly interface and clean design, it truly fitted their planning needs and overall project management goals. What truly impressed Alexandre and the team is “Quire’s ergonomics and intuitive simplicity,” and the ability to attach and share important documents and files from Drives. As a result, overall communication has been enhanced. Limitations definitely do exist when relaying information amongst large groups and impede action, but with Quire, everything stays organized and everyone has the necessary information and resources available right at their disposal.    For challenging projects, you can break down ideas into chunks, and further into small, bite-sized pieces. What you then get is a well-structured, well-planned hierarchical actionable list of tasks and subtasks. When each item has been divided into smaller and smaller steps, you have a nicely laid-out plan ready for action. In our opinion, “nested to do list” is good for planning a project. It organizes your projects and lets you see the big picture. With a heterogeneous mixture of items to do, Alexandre and his team can organize a task list and add as many subtasks as needed with Quire’s unlimited level of hierarchical task. And, assign those tasks to the respective members, which makes things rather less complicated. In turn, providing extra time and focus on the project itself.   Working hand in hand with Quire!   The benefits of working on a clean list, without the extraneous clutter, help keeps their attention and aim on the goal. When utilizing Quire, Alexandre and his team gains a clear and quick overview of statuses and members’ progresses. And, everyone stays on the same page. To their advantage, they operate on a more smooth and efficient plane.    After gaining insight from Alexandre and his team, we were pleased to hear how Quire has helped young generations with overcoming challenging feats in future technological advances. It is our goal to help dream chasers tackle major challenges and actualize their dreams. We seek to continue in making a difference for a better world. And, we aspire to hear more great stories about Quire’s role in pursuing those goals!  ",

If you’re importing data from Trello…        All of your board and cards from Trello will be automatically transferred to Kanban Board in Quire. The tags, descriptions and comments will also be transferred into the appropriate sections. Also, if you want to work with your project in a nested task list view mode, you can switch to tasks. All of your tasks have been successfully transferred there.   If you’re importing data from Wunderlist…        All of the lists from the left sidebar in Wunderlist will be treated as root task in Quire, and the tasks inside the lists will be treated as subtasks. If there’s a subtask in Wunderlist, it will become the sub-subtask in Quire. If you wish to treat each list from Wunderlist as a project in Quire, you can move these tasks to other projects.   So what are you waiting for? Start your journey with Quire now!

Whether you are starting fresh or picking up projects from where you left off in 2018—we got you covered!   For Project Management   Quire — A visual collaborative platform for your projects   Brilliant project starts with brilliant ideas. And it all begins in Quire.   You can easily jot down your ideas and organize them in a nested task list, and focus on completing it in a visual Kanban board.          In addition, we have handpicked a couple productivity apps to help your projects too:   For Communications   Slack — The one place for your teams to communicate and interact   From brainstorming on ideas, sharing what you have done, to searching for messages from way back last month, Slack is all you need.   It brings all of your team’s chats, talks, and discussions together in a single place.          For File Management   G Suite — A must-have online productivity suite   When it comes to storing, editing and managing your work, G Suite got documents (Google Docs), spreadsheets (Google Sheets), presentations (Google Slides) and more.   Take for example Google Docs. What better way to share your ideas with others, work on them, and edit them together in real-time?          For Time Tracking &amp; Time Management   Toggl — A time-tracking app that keeps up with your projects   No idea where your hours are going?

        "excerpt": "   Be it teams, agencies, or companies, there must have been a time when they looked for project management tools or softwares, tried each one of them, and asked all sorts of questions about them, hoping to choose the best project management software to accomplish their next big, amazing projects.   Unfortunately, there is no one-for-all, perfect solution. Just the right one to help you boost your productivity.   What is the Right Project Management Software for You?   We had many users who told us they tried tens or even hundreds of apps they could find out there with no success, not until they met Quire; We also had to say goodbye to one who just cannot get past the digital barrier and eventually returned to good old-fashioned pen and paper.   So what exactly is the right project management software? What is the one approach that works for you?   For us, after years of developing Quire and talking to our users, we believe the right approach is one that bring your dreams to life via planning in “Nested to do list” and doing in “Kanban board.”   The “To Do List” Method: A Simple, Yet Flat List Without Structure   A “to do list” is a traditional, straightforward way for you to remember your ideas, notes and to-dos, and do them orderly.   It is just like in the old days, you would use pen and paper to jot down to-dos in a bulleted or numbered list. It is what most users are familiar with, what comes natural to them.   That said, you can easily end up with a long, and flat list of tasks that are equally important, thus making it difficult to show their relationships.          You can easily get lost in a long, flat to do list  The “Nested To Do List”: A Hierarchical List with Context   We took “to do list” to the next level, and we call it the “nested to do list”.   For big, challenging projects, you can break down ideas into chunks, and further into small, bite-sized pieces. What you then get is a well-structured, well-planned    hierarchical actionable list of tasks and subtasks.   For example, you want to make an awesome video game, possibly the next Lineage M.           You can see the big picture in a nested to do list  When each item has been divided into smaller and smaller steps, you have a nicely laid-out plan ready for action.   “Nested To Do List” and “Kanban Board”: The Perfect Duo   Unfortunately, “nested to do list” is not perfect on its own — especially for teams collaborating on a challenging project — when it comes to “execution”. Thus we brought “Kanban board” on board to complement it.   Dating back to traditional whiteboard with post-its, Kanban is two words in Japanese: 看 (kan) and 板 (ban). It can be translated into “a board to look at.”   Kanban board is visual. It makes it easy to manage tasks, and focus on completing them in a smooth workflow. In other words, it makes up the “execution” stage lacking in “Nested to do list.”   According to Harvard Business Review, such an approach not only shows the progress of each member’s work, but also if someone is struggling and falling behind.   By combining “Nested to do list” and “Kanban board”, two of the most popular approaches to project management today, we help teams bring their ideas to reality.   Take a look at Quire. What it offers is a brand new, revolutionary Agile bridge between “Kanban board” and “To do list”. The best of both worlds.          When “nested to do list” meets “Kanban board” in Quire  Wait! Didn’t Others Already Have To Do List and Kanban?   Yes, a few. But we do it quite differently.   What others do is they treat “To do list” and “Kanban board” as two separate worlds (projects). Take Asana and GitHub for example.   In our opinion, “nested to do list” is good for planning a project, and “Kanban board” is for executing the same project collaboratively. It does not make sense to take a project and divide it into two; Not only is it tedious to manage tasks, but you also lose track of them.   So, What Makes Quire Different?   In Quire, “Nested to do list” and “Kanban board” have very different purposes: the former is to organize your project and see its big picture, and the latter is to focus on completing a few crucial tasks at a time from the same project.   It makes perfect sense to stay in the same world, whichever mode you are in.          Other project management softwares (left) vs Quire (right)  For instance, in a weekly product meeting, you can easily switch to “Kanban board” to see what features are to implement this week and back to “Nested to do list” to see what major milestones are to achieve this year.   In addition, it makes sense to have multiple Kanban boards for a project, especially when a big team is working on it.   You can add different boards for different teams, such as RD and Marketing, for each team to focus on their tasks in the specified board.   You can even further dive into tasks in your own swimlane in the board!      One World, Two Views Multiplied   Such is Quire’s interpretation of “Nested to do list” and “Kanban board”. It is our philosophy of the best way to boost a team’s efficiency and help them sail their dreams.   You can focus on the most crucial tasks, standing unaffected and undisturbed by the rest, in “Kanban board”, and see the big picture of your project that these tasks are a part of in “Nested To do list”, without feeling the pressure of completing them all.

        "title": "Quire Mark III: Nested Tasks Meets Board",
        "excerpt": "   Today, we are proud to announce: Quire Mark III for you to streamline your workflow visually in a board.   For years, many Quire users have enjoyed “nested tasks” to see and organize their ideas into a well-planned list of small, actionable to-dos.   Now, with Kanban board, execution on your to-dos is made even easier! You can focus on your daily, prioritized tasks in a visual representation of your workflow, and at any time switch to see the big picture of your actionable plan.   What Can You Do in A Board?   In the “Board” view of your project, you can add multiple boards, each with different statuses, to better manage your team’s tasks and focus on completing them.   For example, you and your team want to build a mobile app.    First, you have your ideas broken down into tasks and subtasks in the “Tasks” view.          Next, in the “Board” view,  you add three boards named Design, Development and Marketing for different teams each week of the month.          Then, you pick out a couple tasks to add them to status columns like To Dos, Development, Testing and Completed.          You can also set filter like sort by Assignee to further focus on tasks in your own swimlane!          Wait! Didn’t Others Already Have To Do List and Kanban?   Yes, a few do. But we do it quite differently.   For most of them, To Do List and Kanban are two different projects. You have to choose one of them, not both, when working on a project.   For Quire, To Do List (actually “Nested” To Do List) and Kanban are two different working modes of the same project. You break down ideas into a list of to-dos, pick a few out, and add them to boards to manage and complete them in a short period of time.   In short, Quire’s nested “Tasks” view is good for planning and seeing the big picture of your project, while the “Board” view is more for visualizing the project’s tasks for tracking and focusing.          Without You, We Would Not Have Made This Far.   Like always, we want to thank you all for your feedback and support.    Quire 3.0 now offers an Agile bridge between board and nested to do list. When combined together, they give your team an even more natural, smoother workflow from ideas to action.   So have a go! And let us hear your thoughts below.  ",

        "title": "Quire iOS 2.0: New Features and Even Greater Performance",
        "excerpt": "   Quire is designed to help you realize your goals from first capturing your ideas, to turning them into minimal todos for action. Whenever, wherever you want.   Today, we took Quire iOS 2.0 to another level: not only did we added new features, we also enhanced it for better consistency and better UX so you can enjoy the same experience across all devices.   You can see the new features and enhancements highlighted below.   Multi-Select Tasks   You can now select multiple tasks simultaneously to bulk assign tasks.   For example, you can select 15 tasks to give them the same due date at once without going into each task one by one — which is insanely tedious.   There are two ways to multi-select tasks: long tap a task, or swipe a task from the right edge of your iPhone/iPad’s screen.   Then, you can tap on any icon in the menu bar for batch operation.          Customizable Filters   Filtering has never been this flexible and easy with multiple criteria/conditions.   For example, you can filter tasks by priority and multiple tags at the same time.   You can also tap the “star” icon on the right of the filter to save this filtered view for later use.          Dark Theme   We understand how your eyes can feel tired working at night.   To help you work more comfortably, we added a Dark Theme that you can switch to in “My Profile” settings.          Performance and Stability   In this milestone of our iOS app, you will enjoy an even faster speed, and an even more stable Quire.   For example, it is now at least 200% faster to open the sidebar and switch to another project.          Breadcrumbs   Not just when you sort and filter! In Quire iOS 2.0, you can see the breadcrumbs — aka parent tasks, grandparent tasks, etc. — of each task after you filter by Status, including In Progress and Completed, in landscape mode.          Better Consistency, Better UX Experience   We have enhanced our iOS app, matching it to our web app for better consistency, and better UX experience.   For example, notice the assignee, date, tag, priority, etc., icons? They are in the same location as those in the web app to save you time from familiarizing with them.          Let’s kick start your ideas by dumping them via Siri or Camera! You are more than welcome to leave your suggestions or feedback in comments below.  ",

        "excerpt": "   Today, we are introducing an upgraded Quire 2.0 to better your navigation, and experience of Quire — we just cannot resist the temptation to perfect our UI/UX!   In this upgrade, you will enjoy a new UI for easier, faster navigation between your project’s different views, and a whole new level filtering experience to help you focus on certain tasks.   And a big thanks to all our users who have talked to us. Your voice have always been the voice that motivates us.   Navigation, Made Even Smoother in Your Workspace   Some of you might have trouble noticing the navigation bar at the bottom.   Now, this bottom navigation bar—with Tasks and Overview and more to come—has been moved to the top for you to easily switch between your working modes.          And see the “+” and “undo” icons on the right? We have moved them to a more obvious spot too.   Filter, Made Even More Flexible to Help You Focus   Sometimes, you want to look at tasks with multiple contexts.   For example, you want to see all the tasks with priority Urgent and tagged Milestone 1 listed out based on their due dates.   It is super easy!   First, click on the “filter” icon, and then Customize.          Next, select “All Tasks” and ”Sort: Date.”          Then, add “Filter: Priority Urgent” and “Filter: Tag MS 1” by clicking on the “+” icon on the right.          Tip: You can quickly remove an already-selected filter item by clicking on the “X”.          If you want to save this filter combination for later use, simply click on the “Star” icon.          Know that you can make up your own combinations too! Have a go, and let us know what you think in the comments below.   Last but not least, expect more new features - including a Kanban board view to help you focus on what is most crucial - to be on their way!  ",

        "title": "Quire: Building a Sophisticated Mobile App with Google’s Flutter",
        "excerpt": "   A couple years ago, we developed Quire iOS app in Swift. Last year, we chose Flutter for developing Quire Android app. I’d like to share my experience of developing the Android app with Flutter - the good and the bad, the strengths and weaknesses - in this article.   Who we are   I’m a front-end developer of Quire, a simple, lightweight project management tool for capturing ideas, managing tasks and collaborating with teams. For many years, we use Dart on both our server and web so here we are, building our Android app with this new open source mobile development framework Flutter that uses the Dart programming language. Two months have passed since its official launch in the Play Store, I believe it’s time for us to share the journey with Flutter, offer some feedbacks and thoughts, and hopefully enlighten those of you in the Flutter community or interested in joining it.   Why Flutter   One of the main reasons to use Flutter is that we’d like to streamline our development using a single language, and the same platform. Quire is an application that evolves quickly; We release a new update almost on a weekly - if not daily - basis. Maintaining two copies of code has become a burden over time. At first, we tried the so-called Hybrid Mobile App approach like Cordova as a solution, but the resulting UI and UX didn’t reach the standard we’re aiming at. Flutter, on the other hand, has high performance UI rendering, smooth transition characters and a core language: Dart, of which the model is shared on all server, web and mobile sides. Flutter meets our requirements to develop a high-quality, single-codebase and fast development cycle.   What is Flutter   Flutter is a UI framework for Android and iOS apps by Google. We can just write UI code once, and run it on both platform. It also provides a bridge to native, so you can do almost everything that Swift/Kotlin/Java does. The core concepts for Flutter are drawing and bridging, as described in the following:   Drawing Canvas   Flutter directly draws UI on canvas in the UIViewController of iOS and Activity of Android. Our Dart UI code will be compiled into machine code and drawing. That’s why Flutter has smooth UI and transition. If we compare it to CSS, they use simpler layout model, which is better than such CSS complexible layout model.   Bridge   If we need to access each platform’s resource, we can use bridge to transfer our Dart command and data to native level, and vise versa. Since drawing on Canvas is in Flutter environment, there is no need to use bridge to native code, which reduces the cost of context switch, much lower than that of other hybrid frameworks like React Native.   Flutter vs iOS SDK   Flutter is a open source framework, and that means you can quickly understand what’s going on in every API call. What’s more, we can trace the whole system’s architecture and mechanism. If you are using iOS SDK, then you may need to read countless books, from the simplest to the hardest, trial and error for so many times, and thus be able to find the real, underlying rules of logic eventually.   Language Level   If you have couple years of experience in Swift, you may have heard the local reasoning character for Swift. But it doesn’t mean the SDK level has the same one. For example, when we need to set the delegate for UIView based component, or set the callback for the function call in most cases, the related operation flows are always in different sections due to delegate pattern. The callback pattern also causes the callback hell issue.   You may ask, what’s the best async pattern in Swift? Callback? GCD? PromiseKit? Or even Reactive Swift? It seems there is no perfect solution for it. With Dart, we only need to do something like this:  Future scrollToComment(Comment comment) async {   await model.scrollTo(comment.position);   await model.highlight(comment); }  That’s the truth of local reasoning. Right?    Swift gets another point deducted because of build time. Three years ago, we started our model porting and iOS UI implementation using Swift. Our codebase eventually grew and became huge, with the compile time increasing day by day. Nothing is more painful than expecting something to happen in an instant but it takes longer than expected.   We probably can tolerate 2 or 3 minutes of compilation time for release, as this process can be automatic and doesn’t happen frequently. But what if we just change a line of code for style update and checking the result? In the worst case, we have to wait more than a minute!   You may see there are many articles on improving the time of compilation by changing your syntax, which actually goes against the reason we use a new language for clearer syntax and better productivity. Whereas Dart, it not only has Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler to optimize speed for production release, but also a JIT compiler for fast development. Updating a line of code now only needs 0.5 second in most cases. We are quite happy with the result.   Framework Level   Using Storyboard in Interface Builder (IB) to build UI is like a dream come true. We only need to drag and drop to create widgets and everything will be done. But in the real world, UI is not such an easy task to fulfil, especially when you may have heard someone suggesting you to keep the file Storyboard as small as possible, or simply don’t use it.   We finally decided to stop using IB when we reached its limitation and performance impact. But building the UI programmatically in iOS is also a nightmare. For  example, UI components, autolayout, legacy layout and transitions need more codes than you expected; Code block will look disorganized; And you always need to read tons of documents to make sure your implementation meets every rule.   Flutter uses “Code as UI template” in Dart 2.0, composing UI just like a JSX/XML/HTML style. This makes us easy to maintain UI code.  Container(  child: Center(    child: Row(      children: [        Icon(‘smile’),        Text(‘Hi’, style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red))      ]    )  ) )  Layout in iOS’ official solution has never made sense to me. Third party solutions in iOS are always the winner in this bottle. For me, Flexbox is better than AutoLayout-like solution. Its UI composing is much easier and more intuitive. Flutter use Flexbox concept for layout model. In addition, there is a document to guide web developers each step of the way. Being a web front-end developer for many years, that’s obviously good news.   In our case, the case of Quire, the Bridge from/to native is a the last line of defense. We always keep it in mind that if there is no other solution to do that, we can at least do it like what native iOS/Android developer did. This promises that we can deliver any feature even in the worst case, since we are using a beta version framework (which was actually still in Alpha during our development of the first version to be submitted to the Play Store). For example, we found the time it takes to compress a photo is very long (about 50 seconds, 70% image quality) using Dart. With Java code, it only needs 0.5 second.   Things to look out with Flutter   Flutter is still in Beta and evolving fast. We should bear in mind that things may change without any guarantee. Below, you will find a few features I think are missing and should be considered by Flutter for their next or future release.   No scrollTo index API yet   If you are using the ListView, you can only scroll this view by giving the scroll offset. It’s easy for fixing row height case, whereas for various row height case, it’s a little bit complicated to achieve this. Our idea in Quire app is     Give each row a index. Scroll a constant distance to check which of these widget states is generated so to see what the current range is. Search many times for step 2 until our target row appears.   In the case of a super long list, to optimize its smoothness, we introduced the recommended row height variable. Scrolling based on the row height will make sure scrolling can be more accurate, and smoother in a long list.   Model flow and binding with UI initState and dispose   Design for model binding should make sure the model can be listened to many times, and be countable. In our experience, you can bind it in initState, unbind it in dispose, and start/stop the model operation when binding exists and without any listener. Make sure you do not emit any event when binding (e.g. Fire event in initState). Why? Because of the initState/dispose of a state is executing, the event will cause other listeners to receive the event and update the state, while the context scope is locked.   Don’t cache widget. Build is the core philosophy for Flutter   The building cost is not as expensive as you imagined. If you cache it, you have to handle your cleanup as well. Leave that work to Flutter, it can do this using the React concept, diff and only update the necessary one. In our case, the Quire tree view, we tested more than 2,000 rows in ListView (for some reason, we didn’t use builder solution of ListView). It’s much faster than our expected due to Stateful Widget which only generates row states when it’s in the viewport. For the build cache, Flutter has published an article for it.   Most iOS-look widgets are not ready   Flutter is currently focusing on Material design components. It’s fine to use them in iOS because material design is commonly designed for cross platform. But in some cases, it’s not as good as in Android. Take for example the wheel based datepicker. Overall, I think it’s still necessary to offer a user experience that matches the native behavior in iOS.   Input in Flutter   There are many input related issues. For example, in issue #13765, you should be able to see the newline before you enter more words; In issue #5986, there is no chance to know what key the user entered.   Conclusion   Flutter is a powerful framework for creating both Android and iOS native app. We enjoyed it while developing our Android app, and shall enjoy it even more when it’s officially released. Even though it was in Alpha and now Beta, Flutter has always been very stable. Its developers are also very active in answering any question or issues you have.   Being an open source framework, it lets you easily track what’s going on, what’s been fixed and updated. You can even fix the issues yourself and contribute to the community! Flutter - a high-performing cross-platform framework that comes with native behavior - is definitely the best solution for you. We are currently planning to replace our Swift-based iOS app with Flutter in the coming months, and I shall share our experience again when that time comes. Keep going Flutter, you are absolutely awesome.  ",

        "title": "4 productivity tips that make sense for your project in 2018",
        "excerpt": "   A new year is a new start, and it often comes with a new determination to do better, and be better.   If 2017 ended unhappily for you with chaos like sticky notes being everywhere all the time, figuring out what was where in your head nonstop and chasing after your colleagues for updates tirelessly, it is time for a change.   That change, is GTD method. If you haven’t heard or read about Getting Things Done, Proposed by David Allen, it is a way for getting organized and stay productive. Chris Winfield’s system is a simpler vision of it and I call it, the 4 Ds.          1. Dream it. Know the big picture   People say your goals should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timed. In J.D. Roth’s article, it is about being realistic of your dream with hierarchical, achievable goals to achieve it for a large purpose ultimately. I couldn’t agree more.   Let’s say my friends and I have a vision: make the Earth a better place by creating a lightweight, grab-n-go water bottle.   We see how it has become a habit for people to buy Coke from 7-Eleven that come in plastic bottles, or how OLs grab Starbucks coffee in paper cup on their way to work. If we could make a portable water bottle great for all kinds of drinks, we can help reduce plastic waste, and thus contribute to a better Earth - the one and only place we now live in.   Creating it is one thing; Letting people know about it is another story. So how do we promote it?    That, is the question of the day. nt to be, what you want to do and where you want to be for now. Don’t worry about not knowing how to get there. You can fill in the details later.          2. Dump it. Get all your ideas down   First thing first. You can start by jotting down all your ideas. What better way to do it than in Quire? You can dump all of your ideas the second the lightbulb goes on in your head even via Siri.   Let’s go back to the question on promoting the water bottle.   Right off the bat, ideas like content marketing, social media marketing, viral marketing, email marketing, SEO, leveraging the community - just to name a few - will pop up in our head.   We might not have the details on how to do them yet, but it is perfectly fine to just have the rough, big picture for now.   The key here is to get our ideas down before they fade away.          3. Divide it. Organize, categorize and prioritize   What happens now? We have a list of ideas too big to chew. So, we need to break them down into pieces that are smaller, and easier to tackle.   It is just how we humans think. Naturally.   For example, when we brainstorm about social media marketing, we will think of connecting to influencers on Twitter and Instagrams and also YouTubers to help us spread the words; Thinking further down this line, we can ask them to share beautiful, real-life photos, and upload crazy, funny videos of them using bottle (remember how the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral?).   Also, when we think of leveraging the community, free giveaway of our bottle at charity events like marathons and concerts sound like a wonderful idea. Just look at how Mous is featured in Oscars gift bag.          4. Do it. Complete each task one by one   Now that our ideas are broken down into items that have become actionable, my friends and I can starting doing them!   First, we can start by compiling a list of influencers and YouTubers we know or after asking around, study them a bit to know what they are into, and ask them politely via an email or Twitter message to get the marketing campaign rolling.   The more we complete the items, the closer we are to accomplishing our goal and thus our dream.   The nice thing about Quire is each item - or I should say task - has an assignee, due date, tag, comments, etc. You can rest assured everyone, and everything is on track and stays on track.   Time is money, and you should spend it wisely. Efficiently.   So what are you waiting for? Get that crazy, innovative ideas out of your head and follow the 4 Ds steps yourself!  ",

        "excerpt": "   Finally, it is here. Kicking off the new year 2018, we are proud to present to you: Quire for Android.          We took time to craft and create this app for Android, so we can get it right. We made sure the layout, navigation, gestures and look-and-feel were simple, and intuitive to Android users. We also had help from a group of dedicated Android beta users who provided valuable feedback along the way! Here are a couple things to get you started:   Dump Your Ideas via Text, Camera and Photos   You can add ideas, notes or tasks as plain words, using the Camera of your smartphone, or selecting an existing image from your Gallery. Simply tap on the “+” icon at the bottom-right of your project, and choose Text, Camera or Photos.          Divide Your Ideas into Tasks and Subtasks via Swipe   Our ideas are often too big to chew at once. By swiping each of them from right to left, you can break it down into smaller chunks and further into tiny pieces until they become small enough to tackle.          Drag and Drop to Organize Your Tasks   Once you have broken down your ideas, you will get a long, and possibly unorganized list of tasks. You can organize them, and put everything in order by pressing each of the tasks, and dragging it to its rightful place.          Collaborate with Your Team. Even Offline.   Need to give more details about a task? Share your works with the team? Get instant feedback from your colleagues?   All of it can be done easily.   You can type notes in task description, assign tasks to those responsible, attach files from Google Drive or embed images directly, discuss and interact with team members in comments, etc. Even if you suddenly lose internet connection, you can continue doing what you are doing. Everything will be synced once the connection is back.          Smooth Navigations in A Single Workspace   Just like our web and iOS apps, the Android app also comes in one single workspace with easy-to-understand UI - sidebar (project list), tree view (task list) and detail view (task detail). For example, to go to sidebar, tap on the upper-left hamburger icon of the app in the tree view.          Get Notified Anytime, Anywhere   It is important to stay on top of updates when you are on the go. No matter where you are, you will get notified of new activities, and be reminded of upcoming or overdue tasks so you do not miss out.          Dark Theme for the Comfort of Your Eyes   Eyes grow weary? You can switch to Dark Theme in your Profile view for an instant relief.            We recommend using Android 5.0 or higher to get the best user experience of Quire’s Android app.   Like always, any feedback, thought or idea is welcome!

        "excerpt": "   We see it as our mission to keep a simple, clean interface, including a neat task list. However, for those of you who want to easily identify your tasks and projects in a long list, you can use Markdown, and CSS styles to make them stand out. Additionally, if you want to add special characters, HTML entities are supported too.   Here are a couple examples to get you started:   Add Color &amp; Styles to Task Names   If you type a task name like this:  {color:green|a green task}  You will see:          Or, if you type:  **{color:green, font-size:20px, text-decoration:underline|a big green task}**  It will turn into:          This is what a task list with styles looks like:          Tip: You can quickly add some of the basic styles by typing { and selecting the style you want.          Add Color &amp; Styles to Text   Not just task names, you can also add color and styles in task descriptions and comments.   Here is an example:          Add Characters to Text   What is more, you can add special characters and symbols with HTML entities too.   For example, you can enter:  &amp;cent;  Then, it will show as:   ¢   There is more to Markdown in task descriptions and comments.

        "excerpt": "   Quire’s “Shared Links” feature makes it super easy for you to collaborate with your clients. We all know that sometimes, clients have their own habits and it is hard to ask them to change. Now, in addition to asking them to sign up Quire, you can get them to view your Quire project with one single invitation link, and zero effort on their part!   Your clients are just one click away!   All you need to do is send your clients a link. Once they click the link, they will be able to view your project. No need to register an account, or sign in anything! And you get to keep them away from doing the rest to your project.   It takes only a few secs to invite your clients.   First, click on the &quot;arrow&quot; icon beside your project name, and select &quot;Edit members.&quot;          Next, scroll down to Shared Links and click the “+ Create new link” button.          That will generate a share link for you to copy, and send to your clients. They will have till the expiry date to access your project.          Note: Anyone with the link will be able to view your project.   In Shared Links, you can see how many people have accessed the shared link, and edit it to extend the time of access.          Quire not only has your team members in mind, but your clients too.   With shared links, you can easily let your clients see what is going on in your projects, manage who can do so for how long, while counting on them to never do anything they should not.   Got questions?   I have listed a couple FAQs below and if you have more, post them in the comments.   How many share links can I create?   You can create as many share links as you need, and send them to different clients.   Why do I need to create more than one share link?   You may have different clients who need to access your project for different periods of time.   Creating more than one share link lets you manage who can access your project and for how long.   Who can create share links of a project?   Only Admin members of the project can create share links.   What is the difference between sharing a link of a project and making a project public?   When you create a share link of your project and send it to your clients, they can view this project for a period of time.   But when you make a project public, it is open to anyone, not just limited to your clients, as long as it stays public. If there are Quire users, then not only can they view your project, but also add tasks, post comments, etc.  ",

        "excerpt": "   José Luís Prado and his family see it as their mission to bring their well-established melons Melão REI from their hometown in Ceará, northern Brazil, to countries all over the globe.   Founded in 1983 by his father Carlos, José is the 2nd generation of this family-owned business ITAUEIRA. They grow all kinds of melons from yellow honeydew melons to green melons, watermelons as well as grapes, and ship them to countries including the United States, Chile, Dubai, Russia, Holland, Spain and Italy.   Commercializing their best melons from domestically to internationally is not easy.   Not only are the family and their 1,400 employees responsible for harvesting 4 farms, they also need to take care of operations, finance, legal, sales &amp; marketing, etc.   For all of these that they need to do, they found a solution.    “It is much easier to assign people, track progress and review what we have done in Quire than doing all these in a spreadsheet.” -- José Luís Prado 2nd generation of melon-growing company ITAUEIRA    Before ITAUEIRA turned down spreadsheet, they have used Quire for about a month. And now, it has been 6 months since they got the app to help them achieve their goal.   “What we love most about Quire is its powerful tree-like interface which is intuitive, simple and elegant,” said José.   For example, anyone can collapse, expand or filter the tree list of tasks at will in Quire. An employee can filter by priority to focus on a few critical tasks; A manager can filter by assignee to see who did what at what time; The CEO can review the performance of everyone and everything. No more chasing after the team, or figuring out where it is at!   “It is just much easier to do all these in Quire, much easier to track, and much easier to review what we have done,” José concluded. “With such, we can focus on what we have always wanted to do: take on the world with our best-grown melons.”   Brazil. Melons. And Quire.   We all know that fruit farming is a traditional business. But this Brazilian family-owned company ITAUEIRA embraced technology to skyrocket their goal. Now, José and his family and colleagues are able to produce better quality melons, and distribute them to the rest of the world more efficiently. How wonderful!  ",

        "title": "Quire and Slack work great together.",
        "excerpt": "   It is our mission to help you work seamlessly via Quire and other apps you are already comfortably using. With the integration with Slack, we are one step closer.   For those of you who often communicate on Slack, you and your team can now receive updates about your Quire projects right inside a Slack channel, add tasks, comment on tasks and more.   How do I integrate with Slack?   You need to link an organization to a Slack team, and a project to a Slack channel.    Go to Quire &amp; Beyond     Choose Slack and click on Install     Choose the organization that you would like to integrate Slack to     Authorize Quire on your Slack account     Unlink a Slack channel on Quire Organization Settings       Note: A Slack channel can only be linked to one Quire project.   What can I do in a Slack channel?   When you are all set up, here are some commands to get you started in Slack:   1. Get Notified Instantly in Your Slack Channel   You can make a Slack channel follow a project or more for the team to stay on top of changes made in the projects.   Take projects Design Project (with project ID Design_Project) and Marketing Project (with project ID Marketing_Project) for example.   You can type:   /quire follow project Design_Project Marketing_Product   Note: Once you make a channel follow a project or more, everyone will get notified of all activities in the projects.   You can also make the team follow a specific task or more in a project, once you linked it to a Slack channel (see Step 4 above).   For tasks Logo Design (with task ID 123) and UI Design (with task ID 456), you just type:   /quire follow 123 456   2. Add Tasks Directly to Your Quire Project   You can add tasks to a Quire project directly from your Slack channel, and assign it to a team member, set due date, add tags, etc., at the same time.   For example, you can type:   /quire add Logo design @eric &lt;Oct 25; Nov 21&gt; #Design !1   to add a task called Logo design that is assigned to Eric, and has a start date of Oct 25, due date of Nov 21, tag of Design and priority Urgent.   Note: Even when a task is created by you, you need to make the channel follow the task in order to get notified in Slack.   3. Comment on Tasks While You Chat   You can add a comment to a task after a discussion or chat with your team members, right from Slack.   For example, you want to comment on the logo that Eric designed (with task ID 123).   You can type:   /quire comment 123 Looks awesome! Let’s go with Option 2.   That is not all!   There are a lot more you can do from within a Slack channel. Check out the complete list of commands below.     /quire Command List   Add a task /quire add [task name] For example: /quire add Design new logo   Link a channel to a project /quire link /quire link [project ID or project URL] Example: /quire link Development_Project Example: /quire link https://quire.io/w/development_project   Unlink a channel from project /quire unlink   List all projects and their IDs /quire list project   Search projects /quire list project [keyword 1] [keyword 2] Example: /quire list project Development Marketing   List recent tasks and their IDs /quire list   Search tasks /quire list [keyword 1] [keyword 2] Example: /quire list design logo   View specific tasks /quire list [task ID 1] [task ID 2] Example: /quire list 123 456   List members of the linked Quire project /quire list member   List tags /quire list tag   Add a task under a task /quire add under [parent ID] name Example: /quire add under 12 Design new logo   Add a task beside a task /quire add after [another task ID] name Example: /quire add after 34 Design new logo   Edit a task name /quire edit [task ID] name. Example: /quire edit 123 Design new logo   Assign members, date, priority and tags to a task /quire assign [task ID] [@team member name] [!priority] [#tag] [&lt;due&gt;] Example: /quire assign 123 @eric @jess #design !1  Example: /quire assign 123 +@david -@jess +#marketing   Comment a task /quire comment [task ID] comment Example: /quire comment 123 This looks awesome!   Complete tasks /quire complete [task ID 1] [task ID 2] Example: /quire complete 123 456   Delete tasks /quire delete [task ID] [task ID 2] Example: /quire delete 123 456   Follow or unfollow tasks /quire [follow or unfollow] [task ID 1] [task ID 2] Example: /quire follow 123 456   Follow or unfollow projects /quire [follow or unfollow] project [project ID 1] [project ID 2] Example: /quire follow project Design_Project Marketing_Project   Simple Help (and see what project the channel is currently linked to) /quire   Complete Help /quire help  ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Making the best off-road vehicles.",
        "excerpt": "   Not long ago, I talked to Michael, a copywriter whose son goes to a primary school in Austria, about how 100 parents, students and teachers built and run their school together.   This time, Quire made its way into a university in the United States.   Victor Law, a 5th year student majoring in Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, spoke to me about how Quire has helped him and his team prepare for the annual off-road vehicles race.    “Quire helps us stay on track, and more importantly, makes sure we are delivering the best-quality designs.” -- Victor Law Engineering Student at Georgia Institute of Technology           Tell me a little bit about you and your team.   I am the team lead of GT Off-Road, a student led organization that designs, and builds a single seat Baja racing vehicle to compete in the annual Baja SAE competition.   Every year, about 100 collegiate teams from all over the world will come and compete in three different competitions held in different locations. Teams will be judged on their designs, their vehicle cost, and their vehicle performance.   This semester, we are finishing designs for the 2018 competition vehicle, which will first compete in the 2018 Baja SAE Maryland competition, and training new recruits on fabrication techniques.          How did you come by Quire?   In the beginning, we would talk about what needs to be done verbally and get updates of progress through weekly meetings. This was rather inefficient. Sometimes, progress even got lost!   Then, we started learning how to use Trello. But it lacked organizational structure.   Quire was introduced to us by a team member around that time. When the member saw what we were trying to do, he brought up that he had used a solution called Quire in another work setting.          How has Quire helped you since?   With 40 members involved, our team is broken down into various subsystems including suspension, chassis, drivetrain, data acquisition and manufacturing, each responsible for sections of the car.   Quire lets us keep track of our progress visually at any time, and save time in our weekly meetings going over subsystem updates. We can quickly, and easily see who is responsible for what, what are making projects slipping from their deadlines, etc.   Here is an example of how we use Quire: when a subsystem lead assigns a task to a member and whenever the member completes the task, he or she will comment on the task saying finished. Then, the subsystem lead will review the task and mark it as complete if the quality was there. If not, the task will stay in progress until it passes review.    Therefore, not only has Quire helped us to be more organized, but it also helped us ensure high quality designs.         ",

        "excerpt": "   Tasks, projects, organizations and smart folders make up the hierarchical structure of Quire.   In this blog post, we will clarify what each of them is, and illustrate a few examples on how you can use them at will.   Task           Note: Tasks in the middle main panel of your Quire workspace.    A task is an actionable item to be done. It can be broken down into subtasks, sub-subtasks, and so on.   But it can also be ideas, notes or sections that you want to jot down first and divide into smaller items later.   Project           Note: Project in the middle main panel of your Quire workspace.            Note: Projects in the left sidebar of your Quire workspace.    A project is made up of tasks. It is a goal, or a challenge that you and your colleagues, family or friends want to accomplish together.   For example, it can be a marketing campaign you and your team want to run, a cool app you and your designer want to make, a trip to Europe you and your friends want to plan, etc.   Organization           Note: Organizations in the left sidebar of your Quire workspace.    An organization consists of projects. It is a company, department or team that works on projects in it.    But organization can also be a group of projects, or simply a part of your life called Work, Home, Volunteer, etc.   Let’s say you have an organization called Family; You can then add projects that you and your family want to achieve together in it.   Smart Folder           Note: Smart Folder in the middle main panel of your Quire workspace.            Note: Smart Folders in the left sidebar of your Quire workspace.    Smart folder is a virtual folder of projects from different organizations.   Having the full power of a project, you can get a bird’s view of everything happening in the projects you care about, and narrow them down to focus on just a few tasks via filter.   You can also add different smart folders called eg., Development and Marketing to manage different groups of people working on different projects.   They Keep You Well-Organized   Now, you should have an understanding of what a task, project, organization and smart folder are, and how they can be used.   They are a lot more flexible than what their names suggest. Let’s start adding them and organizing your people and work; In your own terms!  ",

Here is a demo video to show you:      What exactly have been enhanced? To name a few, you can:   Swipe a task to instantly do more.          For example, to quickly break down a task into smaller items, you can swipe it from right to left to add subtasks. To complete a task, swipe it from left to right and tap the complete icon.   Launch Quire from your home screen anytime.          For those who do not know, you can pin Quire to your smartphone’s homescreen. Simply go to a Quire web page, tap the menu icon and select “Add to Home Screen” to add a shortcut.   Feel like you are using a real native app.          Once you added Quire to your home screen, you can enjoy an immersive full screen experience without the distraction of the URL bar.   Continue working even when offline.   Since day one, you can continue what you are doing in Quire, when you suddenly lose connection. Now, even better, you can launch Quire while offline, and use it like you would normally do. Everything will be in sync when connection is back.   There you have it.

        "excerpt": "   Today is the day Quire goes big. The day we present Quire Mark II to you, the best-ever-made collaborative task management app to bring your ideas to life.   “Genius is in the idea. Impact, however, comes from action,” said Simon Sinek. Many people have a dream, and they talk about it with every bit of exciting details. What makes it even more exciting is to realize it, to really make a difference. Imagine you adding your own color to the painting called the world!   This is exactly where Quire - Quire Mark II to be more precise - comes in. To help you evolutionize your life, revolutionize the world.   What is new? Just about everything, and more!   Capturing your ideas, and breaking them down for achievement are what we do best. Now, Quire Mark II sets a new standard for accomplishing them with ease, and a little grace. And it opens up possibilities for anchoring your dreams in reality.   Smart Folders: View all related projects at once   To start off, we have smart folder, a folder of different projects from different organizations where you can review, reorganize your ideas and tasks in them.          Profile View: Understand the performance of each project and member   Profile view lets you see in a glance how healthy your projects, organizations and team members are with for instance the % of your completed tasks, and the # of tasks your members are responsible for this week.          Blink Search: Find exactly what you have in mind in an instant   In addition to full-text search, we also got Blink Search for you to fast find whatever you have in mind, and easily switch between all your projects, organizations and members. Press Ctrl+B or Cmd+B (for Mac), type a few characters and get exactly what you want!          Dark Theme: Feel comfortable even when it is late at night   Bored with the light theme?

Here are a few little touches we think you are going to love:   Floating Detail Panel: Keep your workspace clean without any noise   To keep your workspace clean without any clutter, we made the detail panel flippable. And it is easy to flip it open with SPACE if needed.          Members in Sidebar: Easily check the status of every one of your members   We got all your members listed in the sidebar, so you can easily click on them to check their status.          Precise Context Menu: Pinpoint what you need quickly, wherever you need it   When you right-click on the item that needs your attention , we simplified the context menu for you to quickly pinpoint what you need.   For example, when you right-click on tags:          For example, when you right-click on complete icon:          We do not stop here. What is next?   It is wonderful how the existing task tree view helps you see the big picture of your ideas in a nested, hierarchical list. But there is more than one angle to see your project.   We will start with calendar view, where you can see in a timely manner what needs to be done on what day, week and month.   Next, to better focus on your tasks at hand, we will roll out kanban view, so you can easily finish one or two tasks at a time in a visualized, prioritized flow of your work.   What is even more amazing? Intelligent Spotlight, essentially AI that we are currently exploring and aiming to suggest you the most likely important tasks for the day.   These are what we are doing for the next phase of Quire Mark II at the moment. It is going to be better than great!   We were not alone. You made it all possible!   Thanks to your many feedbacks, we made a great leap in Quire Mark II. To name a few, Rafael, Steve, Roman, Philipp, Joshua, Tristan, Andrés and Lee.

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Building a dream school together in Austria",
        "excerpt": "   I am a Community Manager. As a Community Manager, I talk to our users a lot. They tell me all sorts of stories, from what they enjoy the most about our product, to how they recently traveled to Greece for a 10-day vacation.   But there is one that really caught my eyes.   It is a story about a group of people who were passionate, and brave enough to build their dream – yes, literally build it from scratch – all by themselves.          A school for children aged 6 to 14 at the foot of the Alps in Austria.   Situated at the foot of the Alps, and in a quiet and beautiful place in Pettenbach, Austria, there is this tiny school right next to a forest. Schule an der Alm (School at the Alm).   In the school, students choose what they want to learn, when they want to learn.   Many classes take place outdoor, as these 6 to 14 years old children concentrate on the subject of their interests in small groups, climb the trees in a race to the top, experience living in a teepee, go skiing, ice skating and sledging during winter, etc.   They have a lot of special activities, too. One that children are particularly excited about is creative day.   On creative day, they have the opportunity and the freedom to go wild with their imagination, like working with wood to craft their own mini houses to using the sewing machine to design their own clothes.          What makes the school even more unique is that, it is built by parents, teachers and children together!   It began with two young women. And a bunch of parents.   It all started about 10 years ago.   Two young women, together with parents like themselves, had a dream to build a school for their children so they could be educated at their will.   Gudrun, one of the teachers at the school then, worked in a normal primary school before.   When it was time for her second son to go to school, “My son should not be educated the same old way I did,” she told herself. “He should not sit in front of a desk for more than 5 hours a day when half of the time is just his teacher talking.”   So, with such a belief, and joined by the parents she met at Kindergruppe (children’s group) who share the same belief, they took action – founded their own school.   Michael, a gentle, loving father of two from the Kindergruppe, was Gudrun’s neighbor at the time, and so they decided to start the school at MIchael’s home.   A school that his 13-year-old son later enrolled as well.   “I already know Gudrun and how she teaches, so did my son. We just like the people and how they worked,” Michael told me during my interview. “And I believe, real good learning has to come from following one’s own interests, something the school believes in too.”   It was bold and brave of Gudrun, Michael and other parents to be different, to fearlessly hop on a journey to help children educate in nature, out of their own nature.   And it is a one-of-a-kind dream they did not easily give up, or compromise.    “Children should have the right to choose what, and when they want to learn, at their own speed.” -- Michael Praschma a 62-year-old copywriter and one of the parents    It was not until too many children enrolled that teachers, parents and students started adapting their new school building, building classrooms and school backyard.   The adults were responsible for countless duties like cutting the wood, painting the walls and roughing in electrical wiring, while children were helping them to carry objects from one location to another.          Loaded with tasks? They have “technology” to help with that.   School at the Alm is like a big family, and every single person in the school needs to be involved; Every parent needs to spend at least 100 hours helping out with different tasks every year. And it becomes more each year!   If both parents have a job, or if their children have to be looked for, discussion on which tasks are absolutely necessary or not is a must.   In the early days, they tried to do this via emails, a service everyone is used to. However, it later became difficult for them to tell who was responsible for what, how much something has been done, or what decisions have been made.   “Honestly, emails just resulted in tsunami. So, we spent about 20 hours looking for a solution.” said Michael, who is responsible for keeping everyone on track.   For me, it was quite surprising how such a “hand-made” school actively looked for and embraced “tech” apps to help them move things along smoothly.          The solution they found recently is Quire, Doodle and appear.in.   Quire is a central place for task management, where they add events as tasks to further break down into smaller tasks to collaborate and keep track, whereas Doodle is used to decide a meeting time and appear.in for arranging a video call in meetings.   “Doodle and appear.in, they very much enhance the Quire tool to help us get things rolling,” said Michael.   10 years have passed, their journey continues...   School at the Alm has now grown into a primary and secondary school with 32 students, 58 parents and 6 teachers for children ages 6 to 14.   Before they welcome the new school year which begins in September, the school will be busy. Super busy.   An open house day will kick off in May. Everybody will be involved, when every parent, teacher and of course student is responsible for different tasks such as making sandwiches for the buffet, preparing presentations for the information stand, and attending little children’s corner to play with and supervise kids.          Such is the story about School at the Alm.    Did it inspire you to make a difference in the world? Did it awaken the giant in your heart? Do you now have a journey you want to pursue? Just go for it!  ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Delivering what our clients want when they want.",
        "excerpt": "   We all know how hideous it can be for one to take many roles, be responsible for a team, and manage many projects at a time.   Take Nisarg Desai for example.   He is a software engineer, a team leader and also a project coordinator in a startup company called Troot Technologies LLP in India. His team, consisting of a total of 10 people, is divided into two teams and is currently responsible for two projects –– Ecommerce and Android App.   What do they do? Lead a project to its end by finishing the decided functions in decided period of time decided by the client.   And what is their goal? Do it as smoothly as they can.   I had a chance to talk to Nisarg about how Quire made it all possible.   In the beginning, he lost track of his people and projects –– even himself.   Nisarg’s job requires him to fulfill his duties, and at the same time manage multiple teams and multiple projects. This was not easy.   So, he did a search on Bing and came by a blog post which listed and reviewed project management tools. Quire is one of them.   Before using Quire, his team was using Atlassian and Bug Genie. He could add tasks with specific date and time, and assign to specific team member.   But, there were problems.   For example, he could not identify the status of tasks, the priority of tasks, the type of tasks, etc., the way he wanted. Even though he could add status including Done, Failed, In Process, he needed more like On Hold, Stuck, and Deferred.   And when they requested their client what features they wanted, added them, but then the client changed their minds, they were unable to reflect the change in their project easily.   Of course, there are other tools but they can be very limited and complex, and less flexible, for Nisarg.   In the end, they switched to Quire.   Quire has helped him keep track of everything in the past 10 months.   Nisarg has been using Quire for some time now.   With the ability to instantly add and edit tags, all his problems have been solved. Be it tagging a task regarding its type, progress, or priority, they can see everything in a glance, and keep track of them easily.   Back when they were using Bug Genie for their eCommerce project, they could not do the same.   But with Quire, he can tag a list of tasks with “programming”, “testing”, “debugging”, “designing”, “documenting”, etc.   Recently, he added the tag “search on net” to tasks related to icons and UI widgets, as well as “discuss the execution plan” to tasks that they need to discuss, so they can track their project pain-free.    “I am thankful that Quire was created! Now I can keep track of things and do my job at the same time.” -- Nisarg Desai Project Coordinator of Troot Technologies LLP   ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Doing more, while staying small in team.",
        "excerpt": "   For many of us, the biggest challenge is to stay productive and organized as our team grows bigger and bigger. But it is the opposite for Ray.   Ray works as a senior software engineer in Aerovironment, Inc., a technology company located in California, United States. For him, the question is how to get more things done in a team that shrinked from 12 to 4-5 people.    “I found myself having to do many things simultaneously. But Quire has helped me prioritize with my work so I do not feel stressed.” -- Ray Senior Software Engineer of Aerovironment, Inc.    I spoke to Ray about how Quire has helped him stay away from chaos and pressure. Here is the interview in a nutshell.   How did you find out about Quire?   Years ago, I used to use a PIM software called ECCO Pro. The thing I liked about it was that it allowed you to set up hierarchical to-do lists which is exactly how I think about my work. It seemed no other software did that at the time.   Unfortunately, the company went out of business. So I did a search to find a “hierarchical todo list” software, and Quire was what I found.   Was there any problem or challenge before you started using Quire?   Yes, there definitely was.   As our team got smaller, I found myself having to manage many projects at the same time, and trying to remember where I was in each one.   It was very difficult to stay organized, when your to-do list kept growing.   Mind telling us how has Quire helped you then?   I have been using Quire now for about 2 months now. It has helped me a great deal.   For example, it has helped me to prioritize my work and remember where I am in projects that I have to move away from and come back to. It has also helped me discipline myself to write things down, so I don’t feel stressed trying to keep everything in my head.   I use the tree structure to indicate dependencies - subtasks must be completed before their parent task is done.   Lastly, anything you would like to say to the Quire team?   Recently, I have begun adding tasks for my team members, inviting them to join Quire and asking them to check off tasks after completing them.   I believe eventually, Quire might just become the perfect team coordination tool - what it is especially designed to be - for us.  ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Collaborating with people around the globe effortlessly.",
        "excerpt": "   With 30 sales people, 40 fund managers and thousands of clients across the globe, Quire’s simplicity and flexibility allow Green Shoots Capital to keep everyone and everything in one central place.   Collaborating with different people from different countries can be tedious - but not for us at Green Shoots Capital.   We are a Switzerland-based financial company that sells financial products. Three months ago, we found ourselves spending hours each day to figure out who is doing what and what has been updated.   Given that we have about 30 team members (all under 50 by the way) from countries including Switzerland, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Dubai working with 40 fund managers and thousands of clients, the company needed a tool to bring all our team, communication and data into one central place.    “We are a multi-dimensional team. Everything has to fit in a simple system that lets us collaborate easily despite distance. Quire is perfect.” -- Sebastian Schaefer Founder of Green Shoots Capital    The biggest challenge my team and I had before using Quire was being able to easily refer to our clients’ data and keep track of everything that is going on. “We did not want to use a CRM system that comes with too much things and too much complexity,” said Sebastian, founder of Green Shoots Capital. “It simply will not help our team to do what we are supposed to do.”   Now in Quire, we have every colleague as a project and in each project, each client that the colleague is responsible for as a task that includes the client’s profile in its description. If we ever need to focus on a specific group of clients, we just add tags (eg. 10 different tag for 10 different products) and filter by them.   For example, my colleague is working with a client - a top Swiss bank - and she had a meeting to show them a fund product. When I wanted to know how it went and give some suggestions, I simply posted a comment which was nicely time stamped, and so right after being notified of it, she could check it out.   For us, Quire keeps communication between different people from different countries easy, and everything else organized and ready within our reach, in ways it never was before!    “Quire has done a great job for us. It really works for us and is updating everything super quickly and whenever I want to check something, it is there.” -- Sebastian Schaefer Founder of Green Shoots Capital   ",

        "excerpt": "   It is near the end of the year. You are probably getting ready for the Christmas and New Year holiday and planning your trip to the Santa Claus Village.   As such a joyous time approaches, we want to take this opportunity to thank all of you, and share some thoughts and facts before we call it a year.   Looking Back…   We listened to your voice.   We would not be here without you - awesome people who have taken the ride with us in 2016. You are making Quire as good as it can be.   Thank you Tristan for being with us from the beginning; Thank you Mauro for your insanely quick likes and retweets; Thank you Roberto for all the ideas and feedback you shared; Thank you Dimitrios for sharing that beautiful photo of your fireplace.   The list can go on but these are a few.   You are what kept our spirit alive.   Throughout the year, we have users from the United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Brazil, France, Australia, Uganda, Egypt, Ethiopia and 158 other countries who are excited about Quire.   We want to say thank you, thank you all for choosing, sharing, and inviting your teams to join Quire. We cannot express our gratitude enough.   Quire has been acknowledged by you as a simple and intuitive app for ideas as it helps you go all the way from planning, organizing to completing whatever goals or dreams you have with your colleagues or friends.    “Quire is a breath of fresh air.” -- Paul Bohm   “Simple, clean to organize tasks in a complex project.” -- Stuart Mentzer    We see it as our mission to get to know you. We talked to you with every chance we had, and responded to your feedback quicker than expected.   And it was from these that gave life to the features you are enjoying right now.   Yes, we made amazing features.   We are proud to say that Quire has been rocking hard. Just this year alone, we have accomplished so much.   Not to mention the Chrome Extension which lets you access Quire from any webpage and the beautifully designed iOS app for your iPhone and iPad (and yes, an Android one will be available too).   Here are what we have done, at least the bigger ones, in case you missed them:    Multiple assignees Multiple drag &amp; drop Start and due time Reminders Task status Copy and paste from other apps into Quire Auto-add with @, #, &lt;&gt; and ! Right-click on task for context menu Favorites Emoji   To stay in the loop of our latest news and updates, follow us on Twitter!   Looking Ahead…   We cannot wait till 2017 to come. Why? Because it will be an exciting year when we welcome the birth of Quire 2.0 - the best Quire ever made.   It is no surprise that tree list (aka outline) is everyone’s most beloved feature of all. Considering that breaking things down into small pieces is what people naturally do when they face a big challenge.   That said, you can easily end up with a growing long list of to-dos and they become difficult to manage and complete.   This is why in Quire Mark II (aka Quire 2.0), Quire will come with the whole package from easily capturing all your brilliant ideas, to turning them into a well-organized plan and completing its step-by-step actions in a timely manner.   To be a little more specific, you will be looking at outline plus kanban boards all wrapped in an even simpler and friendlier UI.   What You Can Do Now…   It is December. You probably still have ideas dangling in your head.   Now is a good time to dump them out! Simply take about 30 minutes to jot them down and divide them into small pieces, before they disappear at the back of your head.   So, with a fresh new start in 2017, you can get a kick start in that brilliant plan of yours. In the best-ever-made Quire 2.0!   That is a wrap up of our year in 2016.   Without either of our incredible team and users, Quire would not be what it is today. So, thank you for loving it and staying with us.   Let’s dream big, and be different in 2017. Together!    “The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.” -- Oprah Winfrey   ",

        "title": "It is all about time in task management.",
        "excerpt": "   Time is a tricky thing. We all want to get the most out of it by making the right kind of plan, and doing the right kind of tasks in the right amount of time. But, we often fail.   To solve this problem, Quire has got a series of features including start date and time, due date and time, reminders, status, etc. to help you and your team schedule your tasks, and complete them in a timely manner.   Here is an example of how these features are used:   1. DUE DATE. AND DUE TIME.   It is about 2 months before Christmas. Kevin, a chief editor at a daily newspaper, decided to do a piece on how this special day is celebrated in prisons.   He assigned this task to Megan and gave her a deadline of Dec. 20th, 3pm, leaving enough time for the journalist to finish it, and also himself to review it.          2. START DATE. AND START TIME.   Looking at the tasks at hand, Megan thought Nov. 21st, 4pm, would be a good time to start working on the feature story.          3. REMINDERS.   To not miss the start or due date, she has set reminders to 2 days earlier, in case she forgets about it in the midst of chaos and ends up with only 3 hours left to do it.          4. NOTIFICATIONS.   Then, it was Nov. 19th. Megan got notified in both her Quire workspace and inbox, reminding her to start working on the Christmas feature story.          5. TASK STATUS.   With pen and paper ready at hand, Megan set out for an interview with the inmates behind bars. On the way, she changed the status of the task to In Progress on her iPhone.          Not only did Kevin get notified of the progress, colleagues like the graphic designer and typesetter were notified too, thus keeping everyone on the team in the loop.   6. RECURRING.   Every Tuesday, Megan and chief editor Kevin need to attend a team meeting. Instead of adding a task for each week, she simply added one and set it as repeat.          7. CALENDAR.   Back at the office, Megan has imported all the tasks assigned to her into her calendar, so she can see what her schedule is like for the coming week and month.   For tasks with start date and time, and due date and time, a Gantt chart view is also available in the calendar.          Tip: You can sync your tasks to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar (iCal), Outlook Calendar or other.   The bottom line is, we all care about time.   Often, it is not enough to know what dates tasks should be done, but what time they should be done. And it is with time that reminders can play their part to the fullest, with reminders that notifications can do the same, and so forth.   We hope this whole series of features will help you get the most out of time, without getting run over by it.  ",

        "title": "How to migrate to Quire? Copy and paste.",
        "excerpt": "   Many of you have asked about a way to import your work from a different app into Quire, without going through the trouble of entering them one by one.   Now, we have the answer: Copy and paste.   Be it an Excel sheet with data, a Word document of bullet list, or an email from your coworker, you can easily move them to Quire and continue where you left off, such as breaking down ideas into step-by-step tasks to easily keep track of them and collaborate with your team.   Here are a few examples:   1. Text Editor   You may have a bullet list or notes in text editors such as Notepad and Word.   First, you press Ctrl + C (Cmd + C for Mac) or right click to copy the content.          Next, you go to your Quire project, click on a task and right click to select Paste.          Tip: You can skip this step by simply pressing Ctrl + V (or Cmd + V for Mac) to paste what you copied in a Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge browser.   Then, you press Ctrl + V (Cmd + V for Mac) or right click to paste what you copied for preview.          By default, we recognize the list as multiple tasks, with each line being the name of each task and subtask.   We also automatically translate texts like &lt;tomorrow&gt;, #Marketing, @Megan and !2 into due date, tag, assignee and priority, and omit unnecessary numbers, characters and punctuation marks like “-” and “*” which are supported by Markdown.   If you manually select single task, we will recognize the list you pasted as a single task, with the first line as its name and the rest as its description.   Note: The @assignee and #tag you typed must already be your project members and tags to be added.   2. Gmail   If you want to turn an important email into a task, here is what you do.   You copy the subject and its content.          Then, you go to Quire to paste it.          By default, we recognize what you pasted as a single task, with the subject as its name and the content as its description.   We also automatically omit the unnecessary detail like “to me” and “5:25 PM (23 hours ago).”   If you manually select multiple tasks, we then recognize the content you pasted as multiple tasks, with each line being the name of each task.   For other email service providers including Hotmail and Outlook, we will recognize what you pasted as multiple tasks, with each line being the name of each task.   3. Spreadsheet   First, you copy the header and content in an Excel, Google Sheets or other spreadsheet applications.          Then, you go to Quire to paste what you copied for preview.          By default, we recognize what you pasted as multiple tasks, with each row being the name, attributes and description of each task.   Only columns called Name, Assignee, Tag, Start, Due, Priority, Status, Description, Parent and ID, in no particular order, and the cells below them are recognized. The rest is omitted.   Note: The header column names must be exactly the same with the first letter capitalized.   You can create a tree structure with tasks and subtasks by adding a column called Parent.   For the column Parent to be recognized, you need to have another column called ID.          Under the column ID, you first assign an ID to the parent task.          Then, you go to the task you want to make as the subtask, and enter the parent task ID you have just assigned under the Parent column.          Ta-da! Now you have a tree structure with tasks and subtasks.          If you manually select single task, we will recognize the data you pasted as a single task, with the first line as its name and the rest as its description.   Also, keep in mind that if a task has more than one assignee or tag, you need to have a column for each assignee or tag. Each column will have the same header name — Assignee or Tag.   Note: What you typed under columns Assignee and Tag must already be your project members and tags to be added.   When you paste from Excel, there are two limitations to keep in mind:   Date Format.   For columns Start and Due to be recognized, you need to enter dates in the format of the country you selected in your Account Settings. For example, if you selected English (United States), the date format should be Nov 18, 2016. In this example, 11/18/2016, 11-18-2016 and 11.18.2016 are recognized too.   Priority.   For column Priority to be recognized, you need to enter Low, Medium, High or Urgent (not case sensitive).   4. CSV   With a CSV file, it is the same as copying and pasting from a spreadsheet file.   Once again, only those called Name, Assignee, Tag, Start, Due, Priority, Status, Description, Parent and ID and what is below them are recognized.   And keep in mind that if a task has more than one assignee or tag, you need to have a column for each assignee or tag. Each column will have the same header name — Assignee or Tag.   Note: What you typed under columns Assignee and Tag must already be your project members and tags to be added.   In short, we have made migration quick and easy. With copy and paste.   You can now bring your work into Quire, from apps or services that you are probably using everyday, including Excel, Word and Gmail, and get it rolling with your team in just seconds!  ",

        "title": "We’re not Facebook. So why Like?",
        "excerpt": "   What does Quire and Facebook have in common? Likes.   In Quire, we call them favorites. Of course you can ♥ a task and feel proud of the 23 number of ♥ you get, but more importantly, it’s a way to easily see the tasks that matter to you. Personally.   In other words, when you want to focus on a few tasks that are important to you and you alone, you ♥ them.   Below, we dig into favorites a bit more:   They are personal.   You may ask, why have favorites when we’ve already got priority or tags? The answer is because they’re personal.   If a task has priority or tags, it’s shared by every member in the project. That is, your team members can see them, edit them, remove them, etc. But, with favorites, you and yourself alone have the rights to them! Simply put, they’re like your personal bookmarks.   For example, you have a task or two that that you want to focus on this week. You can favorite these tasks, and then filter by Favorited by me to see them.          They are minimal too.   You may ask again, how is it different from followers?   With followers, it’s likely that you’ll follow as many tasks as possible in just one project so you can be kept in the loop of all things happening to them. But, you may want to focus on just a few ones important to you silently too. No one does it better than favorites!          They are social, obviously.   Favorites can come in handy when you want to see where you team’s heart lies.   For example, when you made a list of all the possible features you think the new app should have, you can ask your folks to vote it up. So for each winning feature with the highest number of votes, you’ll know they’re definitely a go!   Worthy to mention here is the difference between ♥ and ♡.   A solid heart means you’ve liked the task, whereas an empty heart means you didn’t like it. The number beside either heart indicates the number of people who’ve liked the task.          Now, you know what you can do with ♥. And it’s not just for fun.   To summarize it in a sentence, favorite is not just about like but more importantly, about focusing on minimal tasks that matter to you personally.   We hope you ♥ it.   Oh and you can choose to turn this feature off in the &quot;Project settings&quot; whenever you want.  ",

        "excerpt": "   Hey, have you tried the recently-released Quire for iOS? If you haven’t, you’re missing out on a whole new exciting way to jump start your ideas!   Too often, we have ideas we want to capture at the very moment, and they may be words, photos or scenes that just pass us by and that we’ll most likely forget at the end of the day even if we have a chance to get them down.   The good news is, you have the iOS app to help you with that! Or, to be more precise, the 3-in-1 Snap to Add. By tabbing “+” and choosing whichever option, Camera, Photos or Text, that suits you at the moment, you can bring your ideas into the world!   Here is a demo video:      And we’ve got a few scenarios to show you:   Via Camera. Snap it at the perfect moment.   It was a Thursday morning.   John and his colleagues had a weekly meeting about their next big project, a documentary film of a band’s huge success in Bell Center, Montreal, as they discussed the stage, lighting, barricade, etc., of the concert.   Did David, who’s an editor of the film, type or write everything down? Of course not!   He took a shot of the bits and pieces drawn on the whiteboard and added it to their project “Documentary Film” to share it with the rest of the team.          Via Photos. Drop it whenever it hits.   Sitting on the floor of a 5-square-meter design studio, Molly and her team were surrounded by piles of clothing and fabrics, brainstorming for the fall-winter 2017/2018 men’s collection to be presented in a fashion show.   She suddenly remembered the photos she took of the Samburu tribal women in Kenya, and they got her thinking, “If Alessandro Michele could drew inspiration from cartoon character Snoopy, why can’t we do the same from them!”   Right away, she added a photo as task to their project “F-W 2017/2018 Fashion Show.” It’s just like what people say, “A picture is worth a thousand words!”          Via Text. List it in a nested tree.   It’s always been Lily’s dream to publish a science fiction novel before she turned 30. Very much like how Veronica Roth did it.   When she was on the plane to New York City, she had an idea for the scene where Demian and his friends need to go to the other side of the world to save Edgar.   Thus, a task named “Rescue Scene - Dragon” was added to her project “Demian the Series” so she wouldn’t forget how the heroes and heroines beat the unbeatable red dragon Firmir and could get back to it once she’s home.          You never know when a great idea might hit you. When it does, you would want to save it in time before it ends up in the black hole of your brain. Get the iOS app now to capture your ideas at any time and place, and take them away anyway you like!  ",

        "excerpt": "   Today, you’re bound to have a Q-shaped smile on your face, because we’ve got special productivity-boosting tips for everyone, especially those who’re addicted to keeping your hands on the keyboard! Now, you no longer need to switch between keyboard and mouse while adding and prepping your task.   So what are they? They’re smart keyboard shortcuts. They can help you add assignees (with @), tags (with #), start and due dates (with &lt;&gt;) and priority (with !) quickly, and more naturally in a single line.   When you add a new task...   You may want to get David to write an article that’s urgent and is related to marketing by Oct. 2nd.   Simply add a task, and type “Write the article **@David !1 #Marketing ” and press Enter.          Your task would, of course, be automatically assigned to David, have a priority of Urgent, a due date of Oct. 2nd and the tag Marketing.          If you want to set a start date as well, simply type &quot;Publish the article @David #Marketing &lt;9/20; 10/2&gt;&quot; and press Enter.   Obviously, when you type @, # or &lt;&gt; (with or without ;), you can use the Up or Down arrow key to select the assignee, tag or start/due date you want.   You can see all the input date formats allowed here.   Note: Priority from high to low is !1, !2, !3 and !4.   When you edit a task…   You may want to add or change the assignee, tag and due date of an existing task.   It’s like what you’d do when you’re adding a new task. For example, you can type “Write the article @Kevin @Megan &lt;+7d&gt;” (counting from today) and press Enter.          What happens is that this task would be assigned to both Kevin and Megan instead, and has a new due date of Sept. 30th.          You may also want to add or remove assigness and tags from a task, without having to type them all over again.   To add one more assignee or tag to a task, type +@assignee or +#tag in the task name.   To remove an existing assignee or tag from a task, type -@assignee or -#tag instead.   When you search for tasks...   You can type keywords, assignees (with @), tags (with #) and priority (with !) to search a specific task or more.   You can also hover a task in the search results to highlight it in the tree list.          Wait, there’s more!   There might be a couple extra useful shortcuts you’re not aware of.   To add a task, you can simply press Ctrl+Enter. You can even press Tab or Shift+Tab to make it a subtask (indent) or task (unindent) while you&#39;re typing the task name.   After you’ve added a task, you can still move it horizontally by pressing Ctrl+Left or Ctrl+Right. To move it vertically, press Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down.   To delete a task? Like you might have guessed, press Ctrl+Delete.   We’re bringing you the smart shortcuts because it’s natural that when you’re adding a task, you already have an idea who should do it, what priority it should have, and when it should be done. So, instead of choosing them after you add a task, you can now do them all together with @, # and &lt;&gt;.   There are also a whole other shortcuts in store you can check out!  ",

        "title": "A plan well-laid, a party well-played",
        "excerpt": "   “Prost!” cheered the Taiwanese girl Laura, the German guy Richard, and a few dozens people as they banged their glasses of beer together while biting down chicken legs, sausages and pig’s trotters in a German after-wedding party in a German restaurant a little past 10 on a Saturday night.   But wait! Pause. Rewind. Before this ever happened, there was the ever-so-complicated challenge: the wedding.   From the tiniest things like what sort of forks and knifes should be plated to the bigger questions like inviting friends and family from 4 foreign countries and keeping the party flow from start to end, the couple needed to think, brainstorm, plan, and carry everything out on top of the hideous amount of work they’re already doing.   To bring about such a wonderful feast, the now happily-married couple had a little help from Quire’s batch feature. It includes dragging and dropping a single or multiple task(s) to change their order, to move to another project, and to reassign their assignee or multiple assignees, priority and due date in filter view.   The app helped them to:   Pick out the To-dos   We all know fruits should be picked when they’re mature and that they’re best to be eaten when fresh. Of course, Laura and her fiance Richard know it too.   This is why they dragged some tasks that should be done first from their “plan” project into their “to-dos” project, completed them in a week, and did the same for the next week, the following week, and so on.          Reschedule the To-dos   It was the 14th of March. Three weeks before the big day. The soon-to-be married couple saw that there were just too many things that needed to be done this week, like that dress that needed to be fixed, the florist to be checked, the number of guests to be confirmed, etc.   Nobody wants to be loaded with work. So, they moved the ones that could be done later to a different due period, and gave them a different due date.          Reassign the To-Dos   One time, Laura’s sister Megan said it seemed too much work for her to find and book a videographer, make a guest book, choose and pack gifts for dozens of guests, among other things.   Looking at the tasks that each wedding helper was responsible, Laura gave a few of Megan’s tasks to their cousin David instead.          Reorder the To-dos   “You know what, these actually don’t belong here,” said Laura to Richard as they went through their list of to-dos one last time on a laptop in their shared apartment. You probably hear this a lot yourself.   What happened is they inserted the tasks under a different category, so the updated list made more sense as a whole and was easier for them to follow through.          In a nutshell, one thing that a wedding, or basically any goal or dream you have, can’t live without is a well-planned and well-organized checklist that can be easily updated, managed and executed. Without it, the process would be bitter and the result wouldn’t be as sweet as the moments the guests tasted!  ",

        "title": "Time to Break the Myth of “Multiple Assignees” in Task Management",
        "excerpt": " We often get asked, “Can I assign a task to more than one person?” Maybe you have this question too. Now the answer is, “Yes, you can!”.   While other task management tools or to-do list apps out there say you may be confused as to who’s responsible for what or tasks may be overlooked with multiple assignees, we say otherwise: there are times that you don’t want to bother deciding which member in the team should handle a task or breaking down a task that shouldn’t need to be broken down into subtasks just so you can assign them individually.   So why did we make it possible on Quire? Check out the three examples below.   Case 1 - Effort to Assign Task   Let’s say you and your sales team have potential customer inquiries coming in, and three people are responsible for replying them.   If you could assign such task to these three people, they’d each receive a notification when a new inquiry comes in and any of them could simply pick it up.   Honestly, you wouldn’t want to make the effort checking your resources, deciding who in the team should do it, or worse, change the habit of how you delegate tasks, just as long as it’s done by the team.          Case 2 - Hard to Divide Task   You and your co-workers need to make an animated video, and there’re two graphic designers responsible for the concept of characters.   This task is lacking specific details, like how many characters, what kind of characters and the relations of the characters, for it to become well-defined.   So, imagine going to the trouble of breaking it down when it’s perfectly alright the way it is.   If you could assign this task to both designers, they’d be able to work it out among themselves to complete it. This is what teamwork is about.          Case 3 - Not Enough Hands on Deck   Here’s another scenario that you may have already experienced yourself.   You and your engineering friends have finished building a product, and since it’s ready for evaluation, you created a task named “Review.”   Of course, you can assign a person to do it but it’d be better if more than one do it, so to give you as many feedback as possible. In other words, the more the better.          Now you know, it’s not always a one-man’s job when it comes to some tasks. Limiting you to single assignee and asking you to decide who’s the best person for the job or breaking down a task that doesn’t actually need to be broken down into smaller ones is frustrating. It’d also be going against how our minds naturally work.   That’s why we made assigning people flexible, so you can get the best of both worlds, without having you compromise your usual behaviors or us compromise our simple UI!  ",

        "title": "Turn Your Projects into Customizable Reports in Excel",
        "excerpt": " They say old habits die hard. So we get that some of you, or your managers, are used to the flexibility of customizing your own reports in a software application you’re already familiar with: Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.   When it comes to that, you can export your projects into CSV formatted files on Quire.   For example, you and your team members are working on an animated video for a client.          After choosing export to CSV, you’ll get a CSV file.  With the CSV file, you can open it with Excel, Google Sheets or whatever spreadsheet application you prefer, where you’ll see a report with all the project information, including task name, priority, tag, due date, assignee and description, nicely laid out in rows and columns.         Based on this report, you can customize it, like adding colors, and also filters and sorts.   Once you’ve done so, you can see a visual overview of your report, and choose how you’ll see the information that matter to you, i.e., items that have been assigned, have priority Urgent and High, and without the descriptions.          You can also group (sort) the items and sub-items, expand or collapse them, similar to how you’d have done with the tasks and subtasks in your Quire project.          See, easy as pie.   For all the Excel whizs out there, you now know a way to customize your own-styled report in spreadsheet softwares like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, and share it with your team members!  ",

        "title": "Keep Your New Year's Resolutions on the Road",
        "excerpt": " New year comes with an opportunity for you to become a more productive, better and happier person by kicking off the resolutions you set to accomplish.   Having said that, people who set resolutions never expect themselves to follow through. In fact, 25% of them give up by January 7. Here’s a tip to help you go from making them, to actually keeping them.   First, make a plan.   How many times have you had ideas, but never had the chance to carry them out in the real world?   What you need is a plan. A plan can be an outline where you’ve taken down ideas, divided them into smaller items and organized them in the order you want.          Next, organize the plan.   You now have a plan, which is great. But you may have trouble sticking to it.   The solution is a plan with details like due dates, priorities, tags and assignees, so you’ll know what should be done, when should they be done and who should do them.          Then, execute the plan.   Even with a detailed plan, you may have difficulty figuring out what you should do next.   By selecting your own filter options, you can focus on just a few tasks that need your immediate attention.   And, more importantly, DO them like Shia LaBeuof urges you to do!          So basically, make a plan, organize the plan, and carry out the plan. Don’t be afraid to change it if something comes up, because you can always add something in or change something, and still focus on what need to be done.   Then, whatever goal you’ve set won’t be a far-off thing you’re shooting for!  ",

        "title": "Out of mind, cope with time",
        "excerpt": "   It was on a Wednesday morning that I told myself, “This is it. You’ll travel to Hong Kong this Saturday to shop at Apple Store, J. Crew and Lane Crawford in the IFC Mall and be back in one day.” So, I booked the round tickets online on Wednesday, self checked on Friday, and left home with a shoulder bag (I remember it was a Longchamp leather bag) at exactly 7am on Saturday. My friends said I’m crazy, and my sister said, “You should’ve told me so we can go to Disneyland together!”   I wouldn’t call it a spur of the moment, an act of impulse, or even a crime of passion. Traveling alone and be back in one day was just something that’s been on my bucket list for at least two years and that I’ve never found the right time to do.    Unfortunately, not everything on my bucket list can be scratched off this spontaneously and easily.   Take developing a comic reader app for iPhone and iPad for example. It sounds simple and straightforward but for a writer who has little knowledge about designing and coding and who is only comfortable with spelling words such as Honorificabilitudinitatibus, it’s more like a daydream than a dream. And yes, I’ve checked out the how to write iOS apps guide on LifeHacker but there’s only so little I could grasp from it.   Simply put, I can’t do it alone. Not in a million years.   In my notebooks, I already jotted down ideas of what I imagine this app to look like, to do, and what kind of people it’ll serve, so I need at least a designer, a programmer and a marketing specialist to help me turn them into reality. In as little time as possible.          This is where collaboration kicks in. As a small team of 4 people, other than my Moleskine and Midori notes that came straight from my brain, we still need to find the right tools to help us ease the pains of communication and collaboration, as well as being somewhat remote from one another.   Here are some tools that I (actually we) find helpful:   For Work   As a writer who needs a place to capture the sometimes out-of-nowhere ideas and come up with the masterpieces, I can’t imagine living without Evernote and Google Doc. You can never anticipate when a new idea might hit and when it does if you’d just be able to finish wrapping up a long-been-delayed blog post. The same goes for the designer with her graphics editors Photoshop and Illustrator and the programmer with his Xcode and IntelliJ IDEA.   For Tracking and Management   If one or more of your team members are working in a different timezone than yours, a good task tracking and management tool is especially important. What we’re using right now is Quire, which has integrated with Google Drive and GitHub, thus making a huge difference for me and our programmer Kevin as we rely heavily on them.   For Communication   Also, be it a 4-people meeting or a 1-1 conversation, we need a communication and video tool to discuss the macros and the micros of our iOS app. Skype is a quick and easy way to have team discussion, and Google Hangouts is an excellent choice for 1-1 chats, which happens a lot between our designer Amber and our marketing specialist Cher. A good communication tool is particularly important because we don’t want to waste the time that each of us has squeezed from our busy schedule wondering what is right and how it should be done on our own.   For Caffeine   Well, this one isn’t exactly a tool and it’s not mandatory. For someone who can only appreciate the smell of coffee, I drink tea - black tea and green tea with my favorite being the fruity and flowery Marco Polo from Mariage Frères - that I make in my 12oz DavidsTea Timolino, with a 2.5g of loose tea for 3 minutes and 45 seconds at 96 degree Celcius (no I’m not picky, it’s normal for making decent tea) at around 8am and 3pm everyday to keep me awake.   You may already know that working with others is never easy. And it’s something that every individual has to do at least at some points in their life. But with just the right setup and tools, everyone on the team can easily contribute to a productive team, and a big dream! I’d love to hear your experience collaborating with your team members. What’s going well and what isn’t?  ",

        "title": "Why Focusing On Productivity Makes You Less Productive",
        "excerpt": "   You are the most productive person you know. Your phone is filled with to-do lists and productivity apps. You’re busy all the time. Your appointment calendar barely has an empty spot. If there ever was a picture of someone who is getting things done, it’s you. You’re the poster child for productivity.   Except that you aren’t getting all that much done. Truth be told, if anyone bothered to check, your output isn’t all that great, and you can’t figure out why.   Being busy doesn’t mean being productive. It may simply mean you are using up all of your time doing things but not necessarily getting things done. What keeps productivity fans like yourself from being productive?   1. Working More Hours   If productivity could be reduced to the simplest numbers, you might measure it in hours.   High output isn’t bad. It’s how businesses function and how things get done. But a focus on high output as measured by time dedicated to work is the wrong approach. Too many productive people think pulling long hours is a badge of honor for productivity.   The truth is, working more hours in a day is detrimental.   Research by John Pencavel, of Stanford University, has shown that working beyond 50 hours a week leads to a noticeable drop off of output. Once you hit 55 hours a week, that reduction plummets even more sharply. Even Henry Ford realized that longer hours hurt productivity as tired employees worked slower and with less accuracy. Ford slashed work hours down to 40 hours to increase output.   Employers pay for the extra hours. Employees give up valuable personal time with family and for rest, and what do they have to show for all of that productivity? Not much at all.   This is tough to believe today, particularly in the tech world where blurring the lines between work and play to encourage people to stay at the office longer is an accepted norm. Just remember, you’d be better off working less than 50 hours a week, with 40 hours a week being the sweet spot for steady output.   Fewer hours, more output. Measure the output, not the hours.   2. Working More Efficiently   Being efficient is part of being productive, but there is a particularly onerous misconception about what is required to be efficient. Namely, the need to multitask.   Is multi-tasking part of using your time more efficiently? Most people would answer yes, believing the myth that being efficient with time means doing several things at once. After all, you can get three things done in the time it would take you to do one, right?   Nope.   Multitasking is a horrible beast when it comes to actually being productive. Your brain can’t actually multitask, only capable of truly doing one thing at a time. By trying to make multiple things happen, you are inducing high levels of stress in yourself. Multitasking destroys your focus, trains your brain to short circuit its ability to concentrate, encourages you to cut corners and avoid detail-oriented work, and in the end, reduces your output by 40 percent.   Not one thing on that list of multitasking negatives promotes productivity, yet most people consider multitasking to be a crucial component to being efficient. The truth is, working more efficiently really means one thing: no more multitasking. You must focus on only one thing at one time.   Part of working more efficiently, once you get rid of multitasking, is understanding your own willpower and the need to say “no” once in awhile. Gregory Ciotti, from the Sparring Mind blog, agrees with the importance of doing one thing at a time, but adding that you must make sure that you are doing the right thing.   The right thing, of course, is the project you have to finish first. That’s it. This is a question of keeping your focus, and that is going to require saying “no” frequently when distractions or new work is about to be dumped in your lap.   3. Addicted To The Idea Of Productivity   Focusing on productivity can lead to a strange addiction, particularly for people who are hyper-organized and perfectionists. They know (and have probably tried) every productivity app, notebook, system, and device around. They are not so much productive as they are addicted to the idea that they could be if they only found the perfect system. In other words, they are addicted to the idea of productivity.   They spend a lot of time reading books and blogs and listening to podcasts about being productive. They memorize systems that will help them get things done. They write endless lists, and are always mindful that there might be a better alternative to their current system so they must stay on the lookout. They read any blog post that promises yet another “productivity hack”, thinking there’s a shortcut they missed.   The key to productivity is to find a system that works, yes, but to stop chasing after something new or better. You don’t get things done by fussing around with new apps and systems, or by constantly reading about how to be more productive or how to hack an otherwise good habit that has worked for you for years.   Choose a system that helps you get things done and stay focused, whatever that system looks like for you. Stick with it. Chasing after a continual promise of something better is a distraction.   Change Your Focus From Productivity   How do you get things done?   You do them.   It is so easy to think that being busy and doing lots of things at once means being productive, but most often it merely means you’re simply busy and distracted. Stop being infatuated with the idea of productivity (and all of its trappings), and instead focus on what needs to be done until it is done.   ",

        "title": "How an impossible mission was made possible",
        "excerpt": "   I remember in the movie The Imitation Game, after Joan Clarke showed up late for the evaluation that involved solving a difficult crossword puzzle, Allen said to Manzies: “This isn’t about crossword puzzles. It’s about how one approaches solving an impossible problem. Do you take the whole thing at once or divide it into small.”   We asked ourselves a similar question awhile back. But it was more of an “impossible mission” rather than an “impossible problem.” We asked ourselves: “So...how should we do this? Do we just jump at it or break it down first?”   It was about a few weeks ago, my friend Neiko, who is a television reporter, and I suddenly had this crazy idea of creating a 90-min film about the beauty of Taiwan - not just of its sceneries, but also its culture, traditions and people.   I watched the long-anticipated Taiwanese documentary Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above with two others friends Iris and Jason. But I fell asleep ⅓ through the film. There were no flow, no plot, no climax for me. The English subtitles were poorly done by the way.   So it got me thinking. Why not create one that has more logic and story to it?   Neiko and I were both excited about it, but feeling lost at the same time. Yes, she works with a camera and I with a pen. Yet, it felt like there were so much to do - coming up with a script, finding the right actors, renting and borrowing the places and equipments, etc., and we had no idea where or how we should start.   With just the script alone, all sorts of ideas came pouring down on us like heavy rains: we want to film the views from the rear of the train, starting with Pingtung, the southest point of Taiwan, and ending with Taipei; we want to drop by each major city and town along the way to shoot the local sceneries; we want to talk to Taiwanese aborigines about the now and then - and hopefully get a glimpse into how the Amis people contributed to the chant in the popular international hit “Return to Innocence” - and visit Hakka people living in Hsinchu and Miaoli; we want to include the fireworks on New Year’s Eve at Taipei 101...The list kept going.   Staring at the notes scribbled on the pieces of paper, we wondered: “So what’s next”?   If it were Allen, the same Allen, not the one who created GTD, he probably would’ve just taken the whole 90-minute video and divided it into step-by-step actions in 6 minutes. We aren’t that smart though, so this was what we did: after we thought about it and got all the ideas down, we organized them into categories and broke them down into doable items and further into smaller actions.   Things definitely looked brighter after the whole scary thing was broken down into little pieces. Of course, it would still take time and possibly help from others to complete all the steps and, ultimately, achieve our goal: a 90-minute video with just as much beauty and twist of tales and smiles, but at least the mission looked possible now.   Today, be it at work or in life, we meet problems, face goals and have dreams that are not entirely impossible but at least challenging to solve or achieve. Do we confront them all at once? Or do we divide them into pieces and conquer them one by one? It’s a question you should ask yourself.  ",

        "excerpt": "   I have a bucket list.   I’ve always wanted to learn the guitar and Japanese, backpack in Europe, go bungee jumping, and publish a book. However, it seems I can always find excuses to postpone them: I don’t have the time, I don’t have enough money, I don’t know where to begin, etc.   This is why almost 10 years later, my dream of writing a book and having it published before I turn 20 never became a reality.   I don’t want to waste another 10 years! It was time for a change.   I’ve heard and read about the GTD method, and so I’ve decided to try a simpler version of it based on Chris Winfield’s system to help me cross this long-delayed dream off my list.   I call it the 4 Ds:          1. Dream it. Know the big picture    “If you can dream it, you can do it.” Walt Disney    First, imagine your ideal life. What do you really want from life? What are your ambitions and dreams? It can be anything you’ve always wanted to do, have or achieve.   For example, you might want to learn a new language, travel around the world, do an extreme sport, be your own boss, publish a book, build your dream house, and so on.   It’s okay to just have a vision of who you want to be, what you want to do and where you want to be for now. Don’t worry about not knowing how to get there. You can fill in the details later.          2. Dump it. Get all your ideas down   Once you have a the big picture, thoughts, ideas and questions will naturally come to you.   In my case, the first thing that came to my mind was I wanted to write a story of young superheroes and superheroines fighting against a supervillain but the bad guy falls in love with the good girl and they - very much like Bellamy and Clarke from The 100 -  run off together and live happily ever after (I know it sounds a bit ridiculous).   Next, I asked myself what should the plot be, what is the climax, how many chapters I should have, how many pages I should write, what publisher I should submit my story to, etc.   The key here is to get your ideas down before they fade away.   Simply use your Lamy or Moleskine to write them down. They can be messy and ugly, but that’s okay. Or, if you’re more comfortable typing on a computer, TextEdit, Notepad or Google Doc is a good choice too. Free note-taking apps like Evernote are great as well, and it even works on your smartphone.          3. Divide it. Organize, categorize and divide   Now that you’ve gotten your ideas down, it’s time to organize, categorize and break them down into actions.   Outliner apps especially one with unlimited number and levels of tasks like Quire will be helpful at this point.   For example, I’ve created my dream project named “My Book” and inside it a task “Characters” with children tasks including “Names and personalities” and “A character relationship chart.” The former children task was further broken down into “Protagonists,” “Antagonists” and “Others.”   I’ve also added specifics, such as due date and tag like In-Progress or Later, to each task , so I know what should be done first and what should have my attention.          4. Do it. Complete each task one by one   This is the step that’ll take the most time, as you’ll need to conquer each task one by one, starting from the easiest to the most challenging.   Obviously, the easiest task for me was to come up with the names for my characters, and the most difficult one that I’ll definitely need help with and I’m saving for later is finding a publisher that’d be willing to publish my book.   The good thing is that when even the most challenging task has been further broken down into simple ones like “Search for appropriate publishers” and “Email appropriate publishers”, what seemed terrifying, isn’t so terrifying.   When you’ve started your dream project, a review of it will help you stay on track.   Every Sunday afternoon, I spend 10 minutes to review my work. I start by collapsing the tasks, so I only see the first-level tasks without being disturbed or overwhelmed by the details. Next, I zoom in to see each task, adding new ones and reordering them. Then, I remove the tag “In-Progress” from those I’ve finished over the past week, mark them complete, and add the same tag to the ones that should be done in the upcoming week.   See, it didn’t take days or months for my dream to look realistic. It isn’t so far away now, because I’ve finally started somewhere, and can clearly see where I’m heading.   Time isn’t free, you’re paying it with your life. Instead of wasting it on imaging what your dream would be like in your head, make it happen. In reality.   So what are you waiting for? Create your own bucket list and follow these steps yourself!  ",

        "excerpt": "   Even though we’re already simple enough and you’re surely smart enough, here’s a real basic guide of Quire:   TASK   A task is the basic unit of action in Quire.   Create a Task   Click on  to create a task.          Tip: You can  press + or Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter for Mac) to add a task next to a selected task.   Create a Subtask   Click on  to create a subtask.          Note: You can create unlimited subtasks in unlimited layers.   For each task, you can add a due date, assignee, tags, and so on. You can also drag and drop any task or subtask whenever its priority or relationship changes.          When you click on a task, you will see its detail on the right. This is where you can do more, such as adding descriptions and comments and attaching files, to the task.          There are easier ways for you to navigate and manage your tasks: keyboard shortcuts.   Click on Keyboard Shortcuts under the Help icon in the bottom-right of your screen, or simply press F1 (Fn+F1 for Mac).          PROJECT   A project is a hierarchical list of tasks.   You can switch from one project to another in the sidebar, after you click on  on the upper-left of your screen.          In the sidebar, you will not only see all of your projects under Projects, but also all of your tasks, tasks that have been assigned to you, in My Tasks.          Tip: You can choose to always show the sidebar by clicking on the &quot;pin&quot; icon.          Create a Project   To create a project, click on “+” at the top of the sidebar.

        "excerpt": "   Sometimes, when you are working on a project, you only want to focus on tasks that are of the uttermost importance to you at the moment, like see the ones you are responsible for, or the ones that are marked urgent.   One way to do this and not be distracted by the remaining tasks is via the “filter” function. Simply decide how you would like to see your tasks, and follow the steps.   First, click on the filter icon…   By clicking on the filter icon below the project’s name, you will see a menu bar.          There, you can choose what kinds of tasks you would like to see, sort (aka group) and filter them further.   Right now, you are only seeing your Active Tasks, tasks that have not yet been completed.          If you want to see tasks that you have completed, click on “Active Tasks” and choose “Completed Tasks.”          Or if you want to see all of your tasks, both active and completed, choose “All Tasks” instead.          Note: You can hide the menu bar by toggling the filter icon. The green dot indicates you are in a filtered mode.          Now, let us sort and filter the tasks further.     When you sort by…   Date   To see all your tasks ordered by due dates, choose sort by “Date.”          This is what you will see:          Note: We group tasks into 4 categories: Overdue, Today, Due in 5 days and Later.     Assignee   To see what tasks each assignee is or was responsible for, choose “Assignee” instead. This is what you will see:          Note: You can click on “Clear” in the menu bar whenever you want to return to the default status, which is “Active Tasks” without any filtering.            Next, when you filter by…   Tag   If you filter by, for example, Appetizer, from “Tags” like this:          You will see all the tasks that are labeled with Appetizer under whoever is responsible.            Assigned to   If you choose, for example, Crystal, from “Assigned to” like this:          You will see all the tasks that have been assigned to Crystal under Crystal.          Here, you can click on “+” to create a task:          The task will be assigned to Crystal directly.            Assigned by   If you choose, for example, Crystal, from “Assigned by” like this:          You will see all the tasks assigned by Crystal under whoever is responsible.            Created by   If you choose, for example, Crystal, again, from “Created by.”          You will see all the tasks that have been created by Crystal under whoever is responsible.            Followed by me   If you want to see the tasks you are following, choose “Followed by me.”          You will see all the tasks you are following under whoever is responsible.          Note: You will automatically follow tasks created by you.     Now that you have learned the different ways to see your tasks, you can try them out and choose whichever combination fits your needs the best!   Bye for now!  ",

        "title": "5 Easy Steps to Quire’s External Team",
        "excerpt": "   Here is something useful for those of you who need outside help, like freelancers, to help you complete a task in your project: You can now easily (and safely) outsource the task with Quire’s new feature “external team.”   Before we move on, you can take a look at the overview to get an idea of what it is. Or we can just get straight to the hows:   1. Click on the Assignee icon.          2. Turn on the switch button besides “Assign an external team”.          3. Click on “+ Add new team”.          4. Enter a name for the external team.          5. Add external member(s) by typing their emails and pressing Enter or clicking on +, then click on Create.          After you clicked on Create, you will return to your project.          Note: When you assign a task to an external team, the assignee will always be the team even when it has only one external member.   Now, you are just one step away!   The external members you have invited will need to accept the email invitations you have just sent.   Once they have done so, you would have successfully assigned the task to them, and they would be able to start working on it.   When you work on your project, you will see the whole picture.          And if you sort (group) by assignee, you will see the outsourced task under the external team’s name.          When your external team work on the same project, they will see only the assigned task. So, you do not need to worry about them seeing your other tasks.          That said, external members can still create subtasks under the assigned task and manage them.          And so can you.          “External team” is a useful feature for those of you who want to focus on the core tasks at hand while delegating those that are non-core to third parties without compromising your safety.   In our upcoming reports, we will go into more details of what you and your external members can do.   Please stay tuned!  ",

        "excerpt": "   In reality, there is not just you and me. There is also them.   Yes, we can survive on our own, but there will definitely be times when we need other people’s help, especially with something we cannot handle, whether it is at work or at home.   But getting help can be a tricky thing. You would not want to have a plumber helping you repair a break in the bathroom and also going into your bedroom doing all sorts of crazy things you cannot even imagine.   And as a project manager, not only would you want a freelancer to only access tasks that are outsourced to him or her, you would also want to include the outsourced tasks into your project to see the whole picture.   This is where Quire’s “external team” feature comes in.   “External team” is a group of people who work on the task(s) you outsource to them.   To get an idea of what it is and what it does, take a look at the example below.   You want to promote your new product and you think having an animation video for it would help, so you outsource this task to an animation studio.   Having received the task, the animation studio would then break it down into smaller tasks like storyline and characters and decide who is responsible for what and when among their designers and artists.   While they are busy doing all that at their end, you and your team members would work on some other promotion strategies.   In this example, the animation studio is your external team, and the designers and artists are your external members.   You give them enough freedom to manage the assigned task, and, at the same time, making sure that they do not have the freedom to access your other tasks.   Overall, “external team” is a one-of-a-kind feature for those of you who want to stay worry-free and in control when getting outside help to help you finish a project.

        "title": "Our Very Own Markdown",
        "excerpt": "   You may have heard of Markdown. If you have, it is a good thing. It can create rich texts, like in Microsoft Word, easily and quickly. For those of you who do not know what it is, here is the introduction by its creator, John Gruber (of Daring Fireball): http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/   So, we have Markdown. Precisely, Quire’s own flavored Markdown.   Follow these 3 steps to see a few examples:   Go to any task -&gt; Add description or comment (or click on Edit) -&gt; Click on the “?” mark   Voila! A pop-up of our markdown list:          Want to add emphasis? You can either use * (wow!) for italic, or two asterisks (wow!) for bold.   To create a list, add an asterisk and a space before your items. It is just like what you would do if you were using Word or Page, but easier and quicker.   Wait, there’s more!   Sometimes, words just are not enough. Thankfully, you can use emoji icons in the description and comment of a task. If you type a colon, a list of emoji will automatically show up:          Talk about being “expressive”!   Next is something you will definitely find useful.   When you want to refer someone to a particular task, just enter @username and then #taskname. All the tasks containing the letters you have typed will show up. Simply find the right one.          This way, there is no more copying and posting the URL of a task.   Now that you have seen what our Markdown can do, see the cheat sheet below and give it a go!     Markdown Cheat Sheet   HEADERS   Quire’s Markdown supports two styles of headers, Setext and Atx.   Setext-style headers use equal signs (for first-level headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). For example:  H1 == H2 --  Atx-style headers use 1–6 number signs at the start of the line, followed by 1–6 header levels. For example:  # H1 ## H2 ### H3 #### H4 ##### H5 ###### H6  LINE BREAKS   To generate a new line, you press ENTER.   HORIZONTAL RULES   You can produce a horizontal rule by typing 3 or more hyphens, asterisks or underscores, with space in between if you like:  *** * * * - — -  — — — — — — — —   EMPHASIS   You use asterisks to indicate emphasis.   For italic, you use 1 asterisk. For example:  This is *important*.  For bold, you use 2 asterisks. For example:  This is **very important**.  UNDERLINES   You can use one underscore at the start and the end of the text:  _Underlined text._  STRIKETHROUGHS   You can use one tilde at the start and the end of the text:  ~Delete text.~  LISTS   Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.   Order list uses numbers and periods like:  1. step1 2. step2 3. step3  Unordered list like:  * item1 * item2 * item3  is the same as:  + item1 + item2 + item3  and:  - item1 - item2 - item3  Each item may consist of multiple paragraphs. To add a paragraph in a list item, indent 4 spaces or 1 tab like this:  1. step1     I’m a paragraph. 2. step2 3. step3  LINKS   You use square brackets to delimit the text and round brackets for the link. For example,  This is a [Google link](https://www.google.com/)  Markdown also supports 3 variants of links. First is a title for your link:  [Google link with title](http://google.com/ “Google”)  Second is the reference-style link that uses second set of square brackets that contain an id you choose for the link:  I use [Google][id1] more than I use [Yahoo][id2].  Then, anywhere in the text, you define your link id:  [id1]: http://google.com/ “Better” [id2]: http://search.yahoo.com/ “Good”  The third is an automated Link. You can simply write down a link, Markdown will turn it into a clickable link:  Google: http://google.com/  IMAGES   Markdown supports two styles of images: inline and reference.   Inline image syntax looks like this:  ![alt text](path/to/image.jpg) ![alt text](path/to/image.jpg “Title”)  You write down an exclamation mark, a set of square brackets containing an alt attribute text for the image, a second set of square brackets containing the URL or path to the image, and an optional title attribute enclosed in double quotes.   Reference image syntax looks like this:  ![alt text][id] [id]: url/to/image.jpg “Title”  In this style of writing, “id” is the name of a defined image reference, which is defined in the same way as link references.   TABLES   You can create tables using | (pipes) and - (hyphens).   Pipes are used to separate each column and hyphens create each column’s header.   So, if you type:  | 1st Header | 2nd Header | | ---------- | ---------- | | text       | text       | | text       | text       |  It will turn out like this:     1st Header 2nd Header    text text   text text    Tip: You can type &lt;br&gt; to break a line in a table cell, and \\&lt;br&gt; to keep &lt;br&gt; in the cell.   ESCAPE PIPE   You may want to escape a pipe in a table cell. It can be done easily with \\ in front of the pipe.   For example, if you type:  | Left   | Right | | :------ | ------:| | A | text A | | B | text B | | C | text C \\| word C |  It will look like this:          BLOCKQUOTES   Blockquotes are indicated using “&gt;” angle brackets.  &gt; I’m part of a very long quote. But I’ll still be quoted properly when I wrap.  Also, blockquotes can rest in blockquotes by adding levels of angle brackets:  &gt; I’m the first level of quote. &gt;&gt; I’m the second level of quote. &gt; I’m back at the first level.  CHECKLISTS   You can create your own checklist by typing - [ ]  - [ ] Checklist item 1 - [ ] Checklist item 2 - [ ] Checklist item 3  With Quire checklist, you can tick off your checklist as well.        Take my dog for a walk    Do laundry   PHONE NUMBERS  (415) 555-2671 (415)5552671 (415) 555 2671 +14155552671 020 7183 8750 0923-234-7890 09232347890  You can type in the phone numbers in one of the above format and the system will generate a hyperlink to make a call.    CODE   To indicate a span of code, wrap it with “`” backtick quotes. For example,  Use two asterisks `**` for bold.  To include backtick characters in a code, you use multiple backtick quotes and spaces — one after the opening and one before the closing — like this:  Use two asterisks `` `**` `` for bold.  CODE BLOCK   You can generate a code block by indenting 4 spaces or 1 tab:  I’m a normal paragraph.     I’m a code block. I&#39;m a normal paragraph.  Or type 3 backticks in the beginning and the end of the text like this:  I’m a normal paragraph. ``` I’m a code block. ``` I’m a normal paragraph.  Remember to break the line before and after the backticks.   SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING   We take code block one step further by adding Syntax Highlighting.   For example, if you define CSS as your content language:  ```css h1 {  font-size: 2.5em;  font-weight: normal; } ```  Or if you choose Javascript as your content language:  ```javascript var setArray = function(elems) {  this.length = 0;  push.apply(this, elems);  return this; } ```  You will see that it displays text in different colors according to the content language you chose, making it easier for programmers and developers to read.   CSS Styles   You can add CSS style to text in task name, description and comment with {css-style| text}.   For instance, if you type:  {color: red, font-size:20px|color text}  It will turn out like this:          Characters   You can now add characters too via HTML entities.   Let&#39;s say you type:  &amp;yen;, &amp;reg;, &amp;#8451; and &amp;#x263B;  It will turn out like this:   &yen;, &reg;, &#8451; and &#x263B;   BACKSLASH ESCAPES   We let you use \\ (backslash) to surround text with characters, so you can escape the characters’ general meaning.   For example, if you want to surround a word with asterisks, use backslashes before the asterisks:  \\*literal asterisks\\*  Then, it will turn out like this:  *literal asterisks*  We support backslash escapes for the following characters:    \\   backslash `   backtick *   asterisk _   underscore {}  curly braces []  square brackets ()  parentheses #   hash mark +   plus sign -   hyphen .   dot !   exclamation mark   YOUTUBE VIDEOS   Youtube videos can be added if you add an image with a link to the video:  [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)  Please stay tuned for more to come!

        "title": "3 Reasons to Be and Stay Lazy",
        "excerpt": "   I’m a lazy person (let’s be honest here, who isn’t).   Though my parents keep telling me ever since I turned 18 that it’s a very bad habit, I’m confident that it’s the key to a better life, and a better future.   Here are my reasons:   1. Save Time   Being lazy means you will find ways or means to get more things done in lesser time efficiently.   If I can express my feelings in two words, I wouldn’t use three; if I can make a delicious grilled cheese sandwich in three steps, I wouldn’t make it four.   Or if I want to create a detailed list of my favorite restaurants in the city, I wouldn’t bother writing it down in a notebook, like my non-tech savvy auntie did.   With so many top task management tools out there, including Asana, Basecamp and Quire, it’s actually quite easy to do so.   2. Less Waste   Being lazy means you are less likely to buy stuff, and thus less likely to throw them away.   I remember two years ago, I had to move from an apartment to another every three months, and with each time that I moved, I carried lesser and lesser belongings with me.   Now, I find myself disliking the idea of buying more goods, since it always makes me feel like adding unnecessary weight onto my shoulders.   Why buy a new T-shirt when you’ve already got enough to wear for one week? It’d be like having the extra credit card that you’ll never use in your purse.   3. More Fun   Once you save yourself time and energy, it’s no doubt that you’ll have more time for other things and people.   For example, you can have dinners with your families, watch DVDs with your friends, go camping with your dog, and even learn something new.   In all, I think laziness is a good thing.   If you’re like me, you like getting things done fast without burdening yourself and still having the time for activities and games, let’s be lazy, or stay lazy.  ",

        "excerpt": "   Humans are predominantly visual animals. We process visual information much better than we do non-visual ones. A lot of people manually add their tasks onto their Calendar once they are aware of the due dates so as to get a more visualized schedule. And it is for this reason, Quire has integrated with Google Calendar to help you do this automatically. Once you have imported a project and set a due date for a task, it will synchronize with your Google Calendar and have it displayed on the right date in a day’s time. You can then view visually which tasks are due this week or this month so you have a clear idea of what lies for you in the future.    How to import? So Easy!    Simply follow 4 steps and you’ll have your tasks synced with your Google Calendar!

        "title": "Turning task managers into a foodie’s best friend!",
        "excerpt": "   When most people come across a “task management tool” or “task manager”, they instantly build up this vivid framework - task managers are strictly for work only, and they don’t think much else of it. Admittedly, I was also one of those people until 2 weeks ago, until I realized there are actually so many different ways you can utilize a task manager once you jump out of that circle and what you create actually becomes very handy!    I turned mine into a foodie’s most treasured list!    As a foodie, I love eating and I love trying out new restaurants. I have the habit of keeping a list of restaurants including ones I&#39;ve been and like, or ones I&#39;ve heard/read somewhere and would like to go sometime in the future. Before Quire, I tried different restaurant apps but none of them really appealed to me simply because    Performance was not ideal I really only need a personal pocket list of selected restaurants, the excess restaurant recommendations on the apps becomes redundant to me. Do not have control over the list’ s order, categorization, filter etc (cannot customize). UI is somewhat messy   After some try outs, I just decided to stick with iPhone’s inbuilt Notes app. It’s convenient no doubt as I could access it everywhere but I didn&#39;t find it was the best way for several reasons:    It is not as easy (compared to PC) to type/copy and paste on a smartphone. Although you could use iCloud on PC but the synchronization can be inaccurate sometimes and would create multiple copies of the same note. If I wanted to add a website URL, an address/phone number of the restaurant, the list gets messy.   These two reasons I can still deal with, but the next two are critical reasons why I moved my list to Quire.    Categorization is not really possible. When the list got too long, I wanted to categorize them according to the types of cuisines but there’s no “layer” or “level” concept in Notes which makes it difficult to distinguish. The workaround was to add # in front of each categorization to identify it as a header but the result is not clean nor ideal (see below).           Filtering by location is not possible.    So… this is where Quire comes in.    Originally I was only using Quire as my task manager for work. I never thought it could become part of my personal life too! It started when I was planning for a trip and was listing down all the possible restaurants I’d like to visit.    First, I listed them according to their types (for example — modern, french, Japanese, dessert etc.). Secondly, for convenient purposes I wanted to group them by location so that when I’m planning for each day’s activities I could plan sightseeing places and restaurants of the same area together to avoid running back and forth.   To do that I had to create yet another list and sort them by location manually!!   Suddenly I thought “wait..why don’t I try Quire?!”. So I started organizing my list into Quire and I thought    This is exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for all along!!    Take a sneak peak:    A nice &amp; clean list, information can be viewed at one glance           As you can see from the above, I put cities at a project level so I have many different projects on the side bar featuring cities around the world (illustrated below).          Then, taking advantage of Quire’s tree structured task list I make each ‘task’ a type of cuisine (Modern, French, Italian, Japanese, Asian, Desserts etc.) and list down sub-tasks under each task as the corresponding restaurants under that particular category. You can also collapse or extend them at will.          So this fulfills my wish of having a nice and clean list in which I can view the details at once (most task managers requires you to click into a particular task to see its sub-tasks).    Filtering by Location    Now, what with ‘filtering by location?” Some of you may have already guessed judging by the screenshots — tags. Yep, that’s right! When organizing my list, I tagged each restaurants by their location (some may have several tags as they have several branches) and then I simply use the filtering mechanism provided by Quire — so simple!   Take an example, I wanted to eat around Upper East Side — I go to the filter bar at the top -&gt; filtered by -&gt; tags -&gt; Upper East Side and boom! I’ll have every restaurant located in the Upper East Side at my command in less than a second! A simpler way is you just click on the tag itself and you will achieve the same result.           Restaurant information viewed in detail panel    Previously, I had a hard time keeping my list clean also because I wanted to include reference URLs, addresses, phone numbers etc. Now with Quire, I simply put them in the detail panel (illustrated below) on the right of each ‘task’ to keep the list simple and clean!           Access it everywhere    Quire is web-based which means you can also access it everywhere — at home, at work and on the go!    It’s your turn now!    So, this is my story turning into my ‘dull’ task manager into something so great I couldn&#39;t have foreseen before. The sharing and collaboration feature also makes it super handy when me and my friend exchange each other’s restaurant list for reference. We share our list and make notes or comments to exchange our thoughts on the restaurants in the detail panel in real time!   I&#39;ve made some of my projects public so you to take a closer look, any comments on the idea or on the restaurants are more than welcome (you will need to sign up in order to leave a comment)!    New York City Brisbane Hong Kong   You can also share with us how you&#39;ve utilized your task manager in all the different ways possible!     Let creativity and imagination blow your mind!  ",

        "title": "WOW moments of Quire!",
        "excerpt": "   Have you ever experienced the   “wow! moment”   when playing apps on your phone or working on a computer?   Like when you realise you can simply swipe left to go back to the previous page without having to touch the “back” button on the facebook app or instagram. The first time you could @name someone, the first time when auto-complete came out.   Or if we go back in time a little bit further — the first time you found out about “Alt+Tab”, the first time you ever used “ctrl+z” to retrieve something you&#39;ve typed, the first time you used “F2&quot; to rename something, or even the first time you realise how powerful drag and drop can be.   These handy features and keyboard shortcuts make our daily operation much easier and eventually become so intuitive that we automatically search for these keys and shortcuts in new apps and systems.   In short, they improve our user experience.   In the development of Quire, we also kept this an important aspect, to create some handy features based on these common shortcuts and UX to make the app as intuitive and convenient as possible.   Many of us, including me, don’t like to move our hands away from the keyboard unless we absolutely have to, this is not because we’re lazy, it’s because we simply don’t want to interrupt our thoughts when a flow of ideas come rushing through our brain. (This really isn&#39;t just an excuse !! )   And how is this important to task management?   Imagine when you’re breaking down a project inside your brain and try listing down all the tasks in their relative places and structure — yes exactly, you don’t want to be interrupted in the process.   Hence!!   Quire provides the same or similar user experience to what you have inherited over the years to make task management flow like a river~   Let’s take a tour at some of the amazing wow! moments you may find in Quire.   Keyboard Shortcuts!          For me personally, I love “ENTER, F2&quot;, “CTRL+ ENTER”, “CTRL + ←” and “CTRL + →”. These shortcuts have proven so useful when listing down tasks. For example, when I type something wrong, I can easily use “Enter” or “F2&quot; to edit the task name like how you can change a file name easily in any Windows OS. After that, I simply use “CTRL+ ENTER” to add another task and finally, “CTRL + ←” and “CTRL + →” also comes in very handy when you forget to “SHIFT + ENTER” for a new sub-task or when you want to adjust the level of your task. During the whole process, I can focus 100% on the content of my task without having to pull my hand away from the keyboard for trivial edits.   Auto-complete!   Like many social media platforms, Quire also supports the auto-complete function in order to create a more lively interaction and user experience. You know that @name function where you can mention someone on Facebook and Twitter? And the beauty of it is that it gives you a list of names available according to the letter you have typed! At the time I thought, wow! how convenient ?! We leverage this in Quire too! It comes in very practical when you want someone’s attention on a particular task. It could be a task you’re committed to but wish to consult the person for some suggestions — simply @name that person in a description or comment, he or she will be notified immediately.          So, now you say what about when you want to mention a particular task to someone? No problem! Simply #taskname, all the tasks containing the letter you have typed will show up, your job is to simply find the right one. No more copying URL of one task to post into the comment or description of another task.          To make work less stressful and team work more enjoyable, emoticons are available in Quire! If you type &quot;:&quot;, a list of emoticons we now support will pop up, find the most suitable one and press down that ENTER button of yours to add a little bit more fun at work!          Drag &amp; Drop!   As much as we like our keyboards, mouse is also something that can’t be ignored. A simple drag and drop act can be very powerful, saving us many clicks and inconveniences. In this aspect, Quire provides a unique experience for users. Apart from the most common ones you see in most task management tools, e.g. you can drag and drop a file into the description or comment area to upload, or drag and drop to rearrange the order of the tasks, Quire also provides the following to empower task management;   (1) drop task B on top of task A to become the child (sub-task) of task A          Note: this concept is derived from Windows’ desktop behaviour, like how you can drop a folder on top of another to make it a sub-folder inside the folder you have dropped on top of.          (2) drag forward or backward horizontally to change its relationship with another task          (3) drag a task with sub-tasks, it will collapse and move the whole tree to where you drop it. The hierarchy of the tasks will thus, not be affected.   For example, if we drag task C on top of task B, the relationship of task C &amp; D remains.          So, these are my wow moments with Quire, if you are amazed by its convenience, you can try Quire here it’s totally free! And remember, to share your wow! moments with us too! ☺   Thanks to Eric Brecht.  ",

        "title": "Make your Product Backlog Speak the Whole Story",
        "excerpt": "   The Conventional Product Backlog   contains an ordered list of requirements often written in a User Story form. These fragmented “stories” do not give us a clear picture of what the Product is, or what values they bring as a whole. The Product Owner, the Development Team and stakeholders all depend on this backlog to fill their roles in Scrum yet this very backbone which they rely on does not present a mental image of the product that’s needed for the team to bring out the product’s value or advantage.   Imagine you’re a stakeholder of our latest task management software— Quire   and you’ll have access to a Product Backlog that, by convention, looks something like the list below:          Each of these user stories is self sufficient in portraying a requirement; however, by sorting them with respect to their Return On Investment, we&#39;ve taken each item out of their context—the core value that they contribute to the product.   Instead, let’s try a different approach in creating a Product Backlog for Quire, with Quire    We first put down the core values that drive the development of our product:           Although these “epics” are too large to be estimated with any reliable accuracy, they do paint a better picture of what values this product would bring.    We then expand on each epic, specifying more stories, or even more epics, that would build on top of these foundations toward our product:           Notice this tree-like structure fits naturally with how we had developed our ideas. If we make the analogy that the product is a tree, then the the epics would be the main branches of the tree. With the conventional Product Backlog, we are picking up a leaf here and there at the ends, stacking them up without seeing what the whole tree looks like.   With Quire’s tree structure, we can nest stories within other stories(or epics) so we’re always made aware of their context and not lose focus on what value we wish to bring forth in the product.    But we are supposed to prioritize the Product Backlog Items?    The convention dictates that we put the Product Backlog Item with highest priority on the top of the list; but there are other alternatives to highlight our immediate concerns than a sorted list.   We can define priority level tags such as PL1, PL2, and so on; upon the Product Owner gets all the necessary information to prioritize the tasks, he or she can assign these tags to tasks that are in considerations for the upcoming Sprints:          Although it’s best to estimate efforts on tasks as a group in a meeting room, with team members often reside on different continents, Quire’s live chat feature is a good alternative   During the Spring Planning Meeting, when it comes to picking the items to commit to the next Sprint, team can then use Quire’s filter function to display only the items that are of immediate concern:                 A Product Backlog should not only contain fragmented user stories   rather, it should speak the whole vision your team has for the product. Coarse requirements better portray value and as we develop them into finer items, they branch into items that are more tangible so we can assess their cost more accurately. A tree structure naturally capture this branching and retains information encoded in both, and as a whole.   We&#39;ve only tapped into how Quire can help us to reinvent the Product Backlog. We’ll explore how Quire can be used to deal with other aspects of Scrum in subsequent articles. Until then, please give Quire a try and let us know what you think.  ",

        "title": "Quire — A design hiding complexity in simplicity",
        "excerpt": "    Previously on Quire…    In my previous blog post, I have mentioned how the simplicity of UI makes up one of the most important key factors to an effective task management tool. I want to take this further and elaborate on how we came up with the design Quire looks like today.    Currently on task management tools…    If you are one of those people, like me, who have tried numerous task managers /to-do lists you may find yourself stuck in extreme situations like the following. Either,    Task management tools being bloated. They overwhelm users with excess choices and features you’ll never use.  To-do lists that serve like digital versions of plain paper providing zero team collaboration features — and we know how important team collaboration is!  Hierarchical approaches are rare while ones available always lack a thing or two, such as easy to change hierarchy levels, organization concept, unlimited sublists etc.     So, the ultimatum for us is to solve these problems by…     finding the right balance between features and simplicity hiding expert functions from beginners hiding less-used features from users making the app work AND provide a unique look &amp; feel on desktop, tablet and mobile devices providing good readability creating a simple but informative overview of organization, projects and users    After numerous discussions and mix match, we decided to go for a clearly structured layout with 3 distinct levels;            Level 1: sidebar with organizations and related projects Level 2: task list Level 3: task detail panel    Now, let’s explore into the design thinking for each of the sections;    Side bar — like a menu   The purpose of the side bar sort of acts like a menu. Unlike a menu of a restaurant which I’m sure you would be willing to take the time to flip back and forth, it is highly unlikely you’d want to do the same to start a day of work like this every morning. To avoid this kind of hassle, we decided to show all the organization and projects you belong to at one glance instead of having to for example drop down a organization before you could see what projects are in it. Having said this, we also wanted it to keep it as simple but as the same time as informative as possible. Therefore we made the appearance of organization and projects different by giving them a different font style. For additional information we display the number of tasks next to the related project.          A sidebar showing all organization &amp; projects   We also wanted you to be able to manage organizations and projects from here; just a click away from adding organizations and projects! In this panel, we also provide an easy but subtle way to access the profile pages of your organizations and projects.     Task list — crystal clear tree structure   If you were a heavy user of powerpoint in high school like me, you gotta love how each slide has a title, some bullet points and sub-bullet points in each bullet point — everything is so crystal clear, like Aladdin and Jasmine on the magic carpet. Well, this is what is commonly known as the “tree structure” or a “hierarchical list” which is conceptualized and used in Quire, showing all your tasks in a hierarchical order.          Crystal clear tree-structured task list   For expert users we also provide keyboard shortcuts for most task operations;          We wanted users to be able to add basic task attributes like assignee and due date here. Besides that you can also complete a task, change the name of it or see tags without having to open the detail panel.   Another feature we are trying to hide from beginners is the filter bar. Usability tests showed that beginners don’t need to group or filter tasks based on specific conditions, therefore it would only cause confusion to have the filter options present at all times. Another way to hide complexity is our unique tree structure. For a simple to-do list, you just list your tasks one after another — simple enough. On the other hand, if you needed to set up a complex project with top-level and sub-level tasks, you can also do that, but easily hide the complexity of it by collapsing the tree nodes giving you a nice and clean view at first glance.          Collapse your tree nodes to give a nice &amp; clean view     Task detail panel — meaningful communication   Obviously, not every project or task is so simple and straight forward. Sometimes, you need to add some details, references, or discuss a particular task with your colleagues — these are shown in the detail panel. During our design process we were trying hard to keep this as simple as possible. In the end, we achieved simplicity by the extensive use of progressive disclosure: Want to see more than the first two lines of a description? Expand it. Want to see all activities related to your task? Expand it. Want to write a comment? Click the input field and it automatically expands and gives you more options for your comment.          All details about the task can be put here   We believe that good usability is achieved by meaningful placeholders. we want to take users by the hands and help them to achieve their goals by providing placeholders like “add tag”, “add description” and “add comment”. Clicking either of those will bring up an input field where you can enter your values.   And this, is also where our value stands — be simple, be meaningful, be helpful.   Let us help you, try Quire, it’s free.     Manage your tasks naturally.  ",

        "excerpt": "   Quire is not the first web application written in Dart and won’t be the last one, but it could be the first app that relies on Dart so heavily, on both client and server sides.          It’s a fun task manager with tree structure to the core. The project itself has 53992 lines, 1620KB of Dart code, built with a few open source libraries from the community.   Who we are   Before we started to work on this project, we are Dart enthusiasts known as the Rikulo team, who have released several Dart libraies, including UI framework, UI library, web server, messaging server, database client, etc.   We were all excited by Dart’s future worth when Dart was first released in 2011, and right away we started to work with Dart in small fractions of projects. Eventually we moved on to build a full application that consists of Dart majorly. Here we would like to humbly shared some of our experience, hoping to give you some information about developing in Dart.   Choosing Dart   There are tons of reasons to choose Dart. Among them, the most important ones for us are:    Dart’s strong type system guards us from countless tiny mistakes. Dart Editor, the official IDE, gives quick feedbacks on type errors and auto-completions as well as easier tracing. We think the class-based inheritance model is much more intuitive than the prototype-based one. Dart offers the chance to use the same language on both client and server side, sharing the same data model as well as code base. Dart fixes most of the gotchas in JavaScript. Dart isn’t perfect on this, but it does take care of 99% of the old bad surprises. Dart has a few popular JavaScript Harmony features available today: Future (promise), Arrow Function, etc. Dart is backed up by a strong team, with many high quality official libraries and well organized APIs. Dart is still evolving but the specification is quite stable already. On server side, we prefer event loop model over multi-threading. Dart performs tree shaking when compiled to JavaScript. (See below.)   There are also cons of choosing Dart:    Dart community is way smaller than JavaScript community. Communication across Dart and JavaScript isn’t trivial. It’s harder to polyfill APIs in a strong typed language. Dart Editor performance is not optimal for large project (yet).   Embraced by strong type support, writing in Dart is much more robust than in JavaScript. Also, Dart is less verbose than Java, and sometimes (for example, with function expression) even less verbose than vanilla - - JavaScript. In general, working with Dart is comfortable, except for a few things:    Final field must be initialized at initializer, eariler than constructor body. Mixin specification is rather immature, and it won’t be fixed before 2.0. No generic type parameter for function declaration, only on class. (Of course, this will increase the workload of compiler.)   Client side   Before Dart VM lands on Chrome, you would expect to deliver your product by compiling it to JavaScript. There are tons of languages which compile to JavaScript, but Dart stands out with a few extra advantages.    In development, we run Dart natively on Dartium, a browser forked from Chormium with a built in Dart VM. We don’t need to compile in this iteration, exempting us from countless interuptions. In tests and production, we compile them to JavaScript and run with all major browsers. The Dart-to-JavaScript compiler performs tree shaking, which trims off unused code from the outcome. This greatly reduces our JavaScript code size.   Server side   Dart on server side was never a hot topic in the Dart community, but we consider Dart as a strong candidate for server side programming language, because:    Web service, by its asynchronous nature, works very well with event loop model (over multi-threading). Server side code demands much more robustness and security than client. A strong-typed language really comes in handy on this.   Supporting libraries   Quire is built with around 30 library imports, and of which 10 come from the community, while the rest are released by Dart team. While you may guess there are AngularDART and Polymer.dart if you are a Dart expert, they are actually both absent.   We are not using AngularDART, because:    We want delicate DOM control. We use unique architectural guidelines to design the client structure, and the paradigm is different from the Angular logic. When we surveyed AngularDART it generated a large overhead on compiled JavaScript code size, but this has been greatly improved.   We are not using Polymer.dart either, because:    Due to encapsulation and event re-targeting, ShadowDOM can’t collaborate with selector oriented framework, for example, Bootstrap. You can’t inject style from the outside of ShadowDOM. If a 3rd party component set is made of Polymer, it’s almost impossible for users to change its look-and-feel. Updated: As of Dec 2013, you can modify internal style from the outside. See Shadow DOM 201.   DQuery &amp; Bootjack   The cornerstones of our client side stack are DQuery and Bootjack, which are both open source projects released by the Rikulo team:    DQuery is a partial porting of jQuery to Dart, focusing on the event delegation system of jQuery. Bootjack is a complete porting of Bootstrap 3, with almost identical CSS and APIs.   We built our application stack along this way to leverage our knowledge and skills from the JavaScript world.   Stream   Stream is our web server, written in pure Dart, equipped with the abilities of routing, filter, server side MVC, etc. Stream works seamlessly with the event loop model. Writing a request handler is just about chaining a sequence of non-blocking routines. It is not only more productive and also more pleasure to work with than traditional multi-threading model. We also scale our web service and handle HTTPS with nginx, and delegate requests to Stream. With this architecture we are able to spawn and despawn Dart VM individually and upgrade the server without interupting user activities.   Conclusion   We have an enjoyable experience working with Dart, and we are looking forward to more exciting developments in the Dart community. Last but not least, if you are curious about what you can achieve with Dart, come and play with our app, Quire. It’s free!         ",

        "title": "Why We Abandoned the To-Do List",
        "excerpt": "   Central to most task management software is a conventional to-do list that stores all conceivable tasks. But a to-do list was never meant to handle the intricacy hidden in tasks which warrants the governance of a task management system.   What purpose does a to-do list serve?   We start writing tasks down when there are too many of them for us to manage them well. Tasks can be better prioritized and tracked for their completion in a written or visual form so they become “tangible” in a way. Simply put, a to-do list helps us to remember (track) and compare (rank) our tasks.   But to-do lists fail to serve their purpose under certain conditions...   As the number of tasks grows, looking at an extended list does not help us much in comparing and prioritizing tasks. The result is a long list of tasks that appear to be equally important. With a sheer number of equally important tasks on the list, it once again becomes difficult to track and rank our tasks.   When we put down “incomparable” tasks forming a heterogeneous list, we make the tasks difficult to compare or rank. Tasks are “incomparable” in the sense that they vary too greatly in their scope and context; hence comparing or ranking them makes no sense.   For instance, if we have both “Read n pages of Book X” and “Get a Pilot License” on our to-do list, they’ll only become comparable if we understand the context which the reading task belongs. Suppose, we recall that a “project due tomorrow” would require that we first digest the material on those n pages in Book X, we can then weigh in on the priority between “project due tomorrow” and “Get a Pilot License”. A heterogeneous list therefore requires us to remember all the contexts associated with each task which would prove to be difficult.   Without exhaustively considering all possible ways to falsify the usefulness of to-do lists, let’s note that a to-do list no longer suffice when the number of tasks is large enough to render them equally important or when the list becomes heterogeneous.      Do the tasks we put down in our conventional task management systems collide with these limitations?   A task with a large scope and long duration inevitably is required to be broken down into more manageable action items so they can be executed. While some large tasks are broken down and expanded, there will be others which would not have proceeded to that stage of their life cycle, and hence we inadvertently created a heterogeneous list. Confusion will arise until all tasks are broken down into a state of homogeneity within the list. By then, the inflated to-do list would become an extensively long list of equally important tasks. Tasks that require the governance of a task management system often have a large scope and a long duration. Entering tasks as such into a conventional to-do list will inevitably render it heterogeneous and the tasks will eventually evolve to bear equal importance; which implicitly reduces their importance.   How do task management software deal with to-do list’s limitations?   Given these limitations, the prevalent solution is to divide the primordial to-do list into several other lists. For instance, the “sibling” tasks are often placed into nother list called “sub-tasks” whereas the “parent” tasks may be designated to a list of “sections” or other synonyms.   A more flexible system may allow a sub-task to bear sub-tasks of its own which effectively is attaching another list to itself indefinitely. This scheme produces a hierarchical structure as depicted below:          Having the flexibility to attach another list of sub-tasks to any given task or another sub-task ensures that we can always “zoom-in” and break down on a task. This process gives rise to a hierarchy which in turn indicates their dependencies. Therefore we&#39;ve eliminated the problem of a flat list of equally important tasks. And because *we now have a hierarchy of tasks, we can organize tasks as such that *we can achieve homogeneity for each level of tasks.*   But how do you convey nested task lists?   Even though the most flexible task management tools would allow a structure of an indefinite hierarchy but showing nested lists is just not practical from a UI design perspective.   But without showing all tasks along the hierarchy, we easily would lose the context that’s required to monitor a task. Take the following task structure for example:          “Get Report B2–1&quot; under “Complete A” requires that “Do Report B2–1&quot; under “Complete B” is done. But due to the constraints in showing nested lists, a compromised view would show:          or          Source: screenshots were taken from Asana.   In either case, we’d completely miss the dependency that “Review A3&quot; has on “Do B2&quot;, since it belongs to a list of subtasks hidden in view. Neither view conveys the context which would rather indicate that one sub-task of one task hierarchy depends on that of another. Essentially, what users see is still to-do lists in their primordial form, but now in multiples, without presenting tasks’ context and relations.      Our solution is to preserve tasks’ natural hierarchy in a tree structure          The problem of linking lists together to form the necessary hierarchy is that lists are kept as separate entities. Showing how many lists necessary to convey the context is not feasible given the constraints in a user interface.   Instead, we recognized that this hierarchy would be better represented with a tree structure. Each sub-task becomes a child node of a task. When a task is retrieved, so are all the parent and children task nodes that make up the entire context.   Under this structure, tasks and their dependencies are clearly presented in the task management system.          A task may start out as a rough goal without a plan or the background knowledge to seek to its completion. The necessary steps in accomplishing the goal only come to existence through more thoughts and collaboration.   As we plan and organize our tasks as they progress, tasks represented as tree nodes can be easily re-arranged in accordance with their dependencies by drag-n-drop as depicted below:          To avoid tasks cluttering our view and lose our focus, we can simply collapse the task tree that are irrelevant to our immediate tasks at hand.   The to-do list helps us to make our goals more “tangible” but it was never meant to become the backbone of task management software.   Nested to-do lists provides the logical hierarchy to accommodate more complex tasks, such as those we find in a project which requires team work and collaboration. But nested lists are still separate lists which divide a task’s context, nor can this context be displayed effectively in a user interface.   We see that a tree structure’s hierarchy naturally captures how tasks evolve through their life cycle. It provides a bird’s eye view of tasks’ relationships. A Task Tree serves as a better backbone to a task management system. We’d love to know if this idea works for you; give the task tree a try.  ",

        "title": "How a Good Task Management Tool can Help Make Your Life a lot Easier!",
        "excerpt": "   In a modern world like this, with the launch of the internet and what comes with it the abundant flow of information makes today’s business world more dynamic than ever. If you are still using sheets of paper or static documents to manage your tasks, you’re out. It’s about time you find yourself and your team a task management tool that would help you increase your team’s productivity, efficiency and performance.   So, how to choose? When it comes to task managers, the phrase “the more the merrier” doesn&#39;t seem to be quite the phrase to use. You want all the necessary features but without all the unnecessary features that would complicate the UI, or slow down the performance. Imagine managing your tasks in a turtle speed, I don’t know about you, but I would definitely go crazy. Find one that balances your needs.   A good task management tool should not only provide a list of tasks you don’t want to forget, it should also have 3 things —    time collaboration. visual hierarchy of tasks and, simplicity in the UI.   Let’s take “Quire” as an example and see how it can transform the way you do things to help you and your team to achieve more work, in less time.   Needless to say, team work is very important. It is the key to successful projects which ultimately leads to a successful company. In order to do this, traditionally we have meetings, meetings AND more meetings which can be both physically and mentally draining, not to mention time wasting. And when there’s a tiny little change in the project or on a particular task, this will happen all over again! To make your life easier, real time collaboration and notification is essential for a dynamic team project that may change at any second.   In Quire, comments of your team members, file attachments, any changes made to tasks are notified in real time working pretty similarly to Facebook notifications. Like you don’t want to miss a comment from your friend, you also don’t want to miss an important piece of information from your project members. You can also see who’s currently online working on the same project as you so you can cue them for immediate response.          Visual hierarchy of tasks. This is something more rare and less found in the market which is rather surprising considering its importance. As the actual executor of the tasks, we don’t just want a list of to-dos, it is important that we can visually see the relationship and hierarchy between tasks. Quire has made this possible by introducing the tree structure — the fundamental pattern we see everywhere in nature. Like how an idea spawns more ideas, a task may lead to several sub-tasks, Quire replicates how the human minds work into the app’s workflow. Your team can easily work your way through completing a big task by dividing it into sub-tasks and assigning them to different people.          Simplicity in the UI (user interface). This is just about as important as water is to fish and air is to you. Easier said than done, most task management tools have appalling complicated UIs to accommodate the many features they provide. But is complexity of UI really proportional to features? The answer is NO. After all, what’s the point of all those good features if you can’t know where to find them?   Quire has a succinct and elegant UI providing you great user experience. You can easily find where to edit your profile, filter your tasks, who’s assigned to what, whether or not there is an urgent task to do, comments of your colleagues, files attached etc. all in a spacious design. You won’t have to make vigorous eye movements to find a particular task. Like Leonardo da Vinci said “simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”.          So now, it is time to chuck out that piece of paper of yours or leave that un-user friendly task management tool you’re currently tolerating and start finding yourself and your team a suitable task management tool! Increased productivity, efficiency and performance will come closer to you by the day. Good luck!   I also recommend you to try Quire, it’s free!     Be Green. Be Smart. Be Collaborative.  ",
