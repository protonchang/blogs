        "title": "Quire Sublist: Bridge the Gap with Team To Do Lists and Personal Productivity",
        "excerpt": "   Do you ever think how amazing it would feel to make the tasks in your to do list disappear and accomplish everything you set out for the day, so you can go home early then continue where you left off with your favorite Netflix show? However, more often, life won‚Äôt go as planned, especially when you are working on a complex project with so many team members. By day‚Äôs end, the team‚Äôs shared task list looks like a matrix and no one would ever know where to get started. With so many team members working on the same list, it&#39;s mostly impossible to identify your tasks and how to connect all the dots together.    üîñ Read more on how to avoid burnout at work   We know you‚Äôve tried your best to optimize your productivity, but sometimes life gets in the way. At Quire, we never let the stress win and make you feel less of yourself. It&#39;s not you, it‚Äôs the way your team works with the to do list. Today, in order to solve the frustration and distraction problems once and for all, we introduce you with the ultimate Quire Sublist - the feature that will change the way you deal with your task list forever.    Personalize the Way You View Your Team Goals   We‚Äôve all been through this: sitting in conference rooms for hours on end where nothing gets done. Everyone has the same proposal and same action plan, but somehow you look at the eye of your teammates and you realize you two share the same feeling: I have absolutely no idea what is going on.    Lost in translation happens more often than you thought. No matter how good your communication skill is, everyone has very different ideas when it comes to interpreting a to do list. The tasks that matter to a manager may not mean that much to a staff. Letting team members have the ability to create a personalized list is the secret to getting things done.       Tip: You can create as many sublists as you want and set different view permission for each sublist.   For one project in Quire, you can have as many sublists as you wish. For example, you might create a sublist named Design Reference and put all of the tasks/subtasks that are related to the task of Design Reference. Instead of creating a matrix of tags that drive all of the project members crazy, with your own personalized sublist, you can focus on the right tasks at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.   And when you are working with the sublists, you can always switch back to the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù list at any time to view all of the tasks shared between team members and the big picture of your project.     üîñ Learn more on how to create a Sublist   Tackle To Do Lists As a Winning Team   We encourage you and your team to dream big but keep the to-do list relevant and straight to the point. If you have too many things to look at, you will end up not knowing where to focus on. Same thing with your to-do list, if there are too many tasks laying around, you will get lost before you even start working on your list.   You can build in as many tasks as you want, your team members can also contribute to the task list and eventually create a big picture on how to achieve team goals. The brainstorming process can last forever until your team gets on the same page. However, when your team sits down at the desk and start working on the task list, you can use Quire Sublist to create a shorter version of the ever-growing list and focus on the tasks that matter to each individual only.       Tip: You can select the same tasks and create different sublists.   There are often some team members working together on the same section of the project. Quire Sublist was born to help you create a focused view for yourself and moreover, for the project members and even the external team that share the same workload.  If you are a team manager, for example, you can select several crucial tasks related to the Phase 1 of the Product Development and create a sublist named Phase 1 then share with your team members. This way, everyone is kept on the same page and they all know which tasks are relevant to the milestone.   The key to productivity is to get focused on what should be done, instead of being worried about everything all over the place. With the combination of Quire MyTasks II and Sublist, now your team can be more proactive to stay on top of the deadlines.     üîñ Learn more about Quire MyTasks II   Be Ambitious but Stay Realistic with Your To Do List   When Quire was born, we shared our philosophy to the world: every great dream needs a doable starting point. You can dream the world but without laying out the groundwork, you can never make your dreams come true. Quire is one of the few if not saying the first to allow users to create unlimited sublists within a master list. Productivity is all about getting focused on the right tasks at the right time. Nested task list, Kanban Board, Sublists are the powerful trio to help you visualize and accomplish your dreams.    We hope Quire Sublist can be a part of your successful stories, whether you are  planning for your company trip or building a rocket. Helping you improve productivity, get things done and achieve your dreams is always our mission from day one. Share your stories with us on Twitter @quire_io or email us at feedback@quire.io.   ",

        "title": "Best New Year's Resolutions that You Can Actually Keep in 2020",
        "excerpt": "   January has been proven to be the busiest time of the year for fitness and productivity tool industries. Funny how for the last 365 days, not so many people think of starting a healthy diet or practicing a proven productivity method to get things done. However, in the first day of the New Year, people around the world are beginning to reflect on the past year and start making resolutions hoping to achieve all of their dreams this year.    The common problem with New Year‚Äôs resolutions is that it‚Äôs always easier said than done. You are determined to buy your first house by the end of this year, you swear with your friends that your favorite jeans will come off a bit easier in the next three months, you promise yourself that your credit card installment will be settled by July‚Ä¶ whatever the case, after a few months into the New Year, you might realize, in your mind, everything tends to work out for the best and you always win, but somehow it doesn‚Äôt look that way in real life.    To prepare for this year&#39;s resolutions, you started to google ‚ÄúWhat are the easiest New Year‚Äôs resolutions to keep?‚Äù or ‚ÄúTop 10 New Year‚Äôs resolutions‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow to stop failing and stick to New Year‚Äôs resolutions?‚Äù. You wonder what you could possibly have done wrong in the past. The good news is, you are not alone. Research shows that 60 percent of us make New Year‚Äôs resolutions while only 8 percent can actually achieve them. Probably in the last several years, the odds just aren‚Äôt in your favor.    Well, 2020 should be different as it marks a brand new decade. We want to kickstart a decade with a clean slate. Instead of keep making general resolutions as ‚Äúlosing weight‚Äù or ‚Äúsaving up‚Äù, we will tell you some awesome easy New Year‚Äôs resolutions that are not too difficult to keep for you to be more productive in 2020.           1. Create a simple doable task list   It‚Äôs already 20 years into the 2000s, stop trying to be Superman. Don‚Äôt keep adding on your to-do list and by the end of the day, your own list will discourage you from achieving your goal. People tend to fall into the blue funk when their to-do list gets really overwhelming and unwieldy with thousands of to-dos and no end in sight.   Everyone wants to move mountains, but you have to start small in order to achieve a big dream. Years ago, we have proposed how you should abandon your to-do list since we realized a to-do list no longer serves its original purpose when the number of tasks is too large to render them equally important. You shouldn‚Äôt have a plain list either, use a hierarchical to-do list instead to break down your goal into digestible tasks.      Take time to step back and evaluate your current to-do list. If there are more than 10 tasks for you everyday, chances are you might give up on your own list in the next couple weeks. Stay minimal when it comes to setting up a new goal. You have to work on your goal constantly, just like Rome wasn‚Äôt built in one day.    2. Treat yourself better and say no to stress          Everyone is obsessed with the fast-paced life, ‚Äúmake more money, it‚Äôs better to cry in a Ferrari than on a public bus‚Äù - they said. After all of the extra hours you are putting in at work hoping for a better paycheck by the end of the month, you might as well ask yourself if everything is worth the stress.    It‚Äôs not always just your body, sometimes your mind breaks as well. You are always on the race to complete as many tasks as possible. Your happiness seems to depend on your quarterly KPI. In 2020, be your own hero by taking care of your mental health and putting yourself first.    One of the favorite tricks from famous entrepreneurs to achieve higher productivity at work is that you can start your day with a simple task and accelerate from there. Try not to think of a big goal that might stress you out, just pick up some routine tasks to ease yourself into the process. Keep yourself happy instead of busy.    3. Keep a journal and count your blessings   If you always feel doomed and unhappy with your life, whining about it won‚Äôt make any difference.  You cannot sit still and expect life to eventually make sense one day just like some of the best-selling self-help books write about. There‚Äôs something called ‚Äúpersonal growing process‚Äù and it means you need to give yourself some time to grow and achieve your goals.           Keeping a journal can help you reflect on yourself and see how much you‚Äôve changed and improved. You don‚Äôt have to write a whole 1000-word essay for your journal entry. Keep it short and straight-to-the-point. Just write some short entries everyday even when that day is uneventful and plain. The point is to jot down a couple of thoughts and things that happened and how you feel about it.    If you are not fond of writing, taking photos and putting them into an organized list can also do the trick. Your to-do list doesn‚Äôt have to be a real to-do list, be creative and use the task as a daily journal entry. After a while, you can revisit your journal and realize even when you don‚Äôt think you made any progress, everything actually has changed and you‚Äôre no longer standing in your original spot anymore.    4. Do something different at least once a month   Boredom can not only kill your joy but also kill your productivity. But a lot of people are hesitant of changes. The problem is when thinking about changes, everyone thinks of something huge, like moving across the country or learn how to skydiving. You will get excited for a couple of days (or weeks!) but soon after the honeymoon phase is over, welcome back to the loop of hell!   Instead of breaking your routine all at once, start with some small details: try to take another road on the way home from work, dine in a new opening restaurant nearby, wear a colorful shirt to work instead of suits and ties, etc.  Happiness can come from small details that sometimes go unnoticed.           5. Stick to the resolutions even if you fail several times before   There is no particular reason when it comes to the reason why people keep failing their resolutions. Life happens and your busy schedule gets in the way. A lot of people sign up for a fitness program and after accidentally skip the cardio class once or twice, they start to give up for good. If you don‚Äôt want to start over, don‚Äôt quit. But even if you already quit several times, starting over still seems better than doing nothing.    Whatever in your New Year‚Äôs resolution list, just start right now for your trial period. Don‚Äôt procrastinate and wait until January 1, 2020 to start going to the gym or opening a saving account. Who cares if you binge over the holiday break or miss a few leg days, just stick to your diet whenever you can. Train your mind to be committed to your ultimate goal and your resolutions‚Äô list.    Every December the internet will be flooded with thousands of articles to tell you how to keep your New Year‚Äôs resolutions and you will keep telling yourself this year would be different. Most New Year‚Äôs resolutions will be broken during the first month. We hope you are strong enough to force yourself to stick to your goals through March at least, then you will notice it is easier to keep this resolution when it becomes a habit already.    No matter what resolution is on your list this year, we hope you will achieve your dreams in 2020.

        "title": "What a year it‚Äôs been: Looking back at the incredible journey with Quire in 2019",
        "excerpt": "   If you feel like the last 365 days just flown by in a blink, well, you are not alone. Christmas is rolling around and soon we will be making toasts celebrating another promising 365 days. By all accounts, 2019 has been a remarkable year for us at Quire and we would like to take a moment and share with you the incredible journey of the last 12 months.    Robust and reliable experience wrapped in the most elegant interface   Quire is committed to bringing you the most powerful features and still keeping the clean and elegant interface. On the surface, you might not notice the differences, but in the last 365 days, we have enhanced a lot of existing not-so-obvious functions along with created several breakthroughs with the new features.    One of the fascinating features that captures everyone‚Äôs hearts is Peekaboo. Our philosophy when developing Quire is to get focused on your work and get things done. Peekaboo feature was born to tuck away the irrelevant tasks in your list and let you come back and work on those tasks later. We want to deliver the amazing feeling of confidence in getting goals accomplished rather than let you worry about your task list.   For years a lot of Quireans have raised the attention to us for more dynamic sorting and filtering options. We‚Äôve heard you loud and clear. We made some adjustments and improvements to let you be creative with the sorting and filtering. Now that you are free to view your to-do lists however you want.    Make your work faster, smarter and more interesting   2019 marks another milestone for Quire team when we introduced the first version ever of Quire Open API. We truly believe the sky‚Äôs the limit and with Quire Open API, you can build scripts and integrate your favorite applications with Quire. Also, we introduced a brand new Quire App Directory for our users to search for the integrations and make Quire a better and more complete tool.    We believe high productivity starts with daily routines. In 2019, we redesigned and released My Tasks II so that you can start your day with a clean slate. Instead of getting lost in your to-do list, now you can have your own task list that includes only the tasks that are relevant to you. Before, when adding a task, you have to be specific about the project that the task goes into. With the renovated My Tasks II, don‚Äôt worry, you can start adding the task to your My Tasks.    Connect team members and bring simplicity to teamwork   Helping team to accomplish dreams and goals is always Quire‚Äôs core value. There are more than 100,000 teams trusted Quire with their projects. We have helped ten thousands of remote teams to connect and collaborate together.    The one thing that all of the teams on Quire shares in common  is that they work remotely with thousands of tasks assigned for dozens of team members. They have no time to get bogged down in project management.  As a dynamic team ourselves, we value simplicity over complexity. No one got time to learn a complicated system before actually getting things done.    In 2019, Quire has been available in another 3 languages: Japanese, Spanish and French. It‚Äôs always our ultimate goal to connect global team remotely and create a culture of trust and productivity. With 7 languages in total, we hope to deliver a reliable platform to bring diverse teams together (even if you are thousands of miles apart!).    We are as excited about 2020 as you are‚Ä¶   It still feels unreal to think how the last 20 years of the 2000s just flashed by and here we are, ready to conquer the next goals in life. As a team, we know how challenging it is when it comes to project management. But we also know how wonderful it feels when you finally achieve your dream!   Thank you for being a part of this marvelous journey with us! Everything is possible because of you and your continuous support for Quire. We couldn‚Äôt have made this far if it‚Äôs not for you :)    Get ready for 2020 - a brand new chapter that will bring hope, opportunities and success to you and your team. We are very excited for what the future holds for Quire in 2020. Follow us on Twitter to get the latest updates and news from Quire!   Happy Holidays Greetings from all of us!   ",

        "title": "Meet Quire Team: Our Favorite Productivity Things in 2019",
        "excerpt": "   There are thousands of books, videos and blog posts available everywhere to teach you how to get more productive. The problem is, those pieces of advice can get very cliche and most of the time, you will forget everything you‚Äôve just read in just 10 minutes, let alone follow the tips to improve your productivity.   As a team who specializes in creating a tool to help everyone with workload efficiency, Quire team has put together a list of our favorites to keep a healthy work-life balance and help you improve your productivity in 2020!    Top Productivity Apps: Quire, Slack, Google Drive   A good to-do list is an essential tool for anyone who wants to improve productivity. By writing down all of the things you have to do in one day or one week, you have a big picture of your task list so that you can steer your mind to focus on what really matters instead of being all over the place.    Quire provides users an infinite nested task list so that you can write down whatever in your mind and organize those tasks into a hierarchical order. Unlike the common flat task list that other project management software offers, a nested to-do list provides the logical hierarchy to accommodate more complex tasks and make team collaboration easier.   As a remote team that works in different locations and sometimes different timezone, it‚Äôs critical for Quire to find the most effective way to communicate. We‚Äôve been using Slack integration with Quire for years to message and collaborate with other members. Many international companies with remote working culture such as Google, Amazon, Apple, etc. also swear by a good communicating system to enhance the team collaboration.   If you ever work on a huge project that requires all hands on deck, up to a point you will get very frustrated with all of the scattered information and paperwork. Quire team isn‚Äôt an exception. However, thanks to the integration between Quire and Google Drive, we create a file cabinet to securely store everything, from  the documents, presentations to photos on Google Drive and link them to the relevant tasks on Quire. This way, all of the information is centralized and can be accessed from anywhere at anytime.      Top Productivity Hacks: Create time block, Break the Myth of Multitasking, KonMari‚Äôd your task list   We are a dynamic team that often has to manage several on-going projects at the same time. You might guess all of us are multitaskers, however, on the contrary, we do not believe in multitasking.    Breaking the Myth of Multitasking   Studies from the University of Sussex and University of London found that multitasking can harm your performance, let your productivity take a hit, and even damage your brain. Multitasking only works if the tasks are second nature to you, which means you can complete the task without thinking too much about it. For instance, you can take a shower and listen to music at the same time, since those two tasks do not require ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù to complete. However, working on different tasks at the same time for a complex project that requires real thoughts will not be that easy.    Instead of trying to multitask our way, Quire team deployed the new method called ‚Äúserial tasking‚Äù using a clean task list to constantly work on individual tasks and eventually complete the whole project. We also use Kanban board to track the project progress as well as other team members‚Äô workload.   KonMari‚Äôd your projects   The KonMari method lets you declutter your house and even your workspace. We are often caught in the rush at work, drown in hundreds of emails everyday and overwhelmed with the never-ending task list.    When Quire team first deployed the KonMari method in our daily job, we started with the mailbox and the task list. Label every email and every task based on the priority, due dates, and team members. Now your task list and mailbox do not look like a digital apocalypse anymore and you can stay on top of what‚Äôs most important and respond to the essentials only.   Time block your schedule   9:30am - 11:30am should be reserved for critical tasks that require your full attention because your daily dose of caffeine just finds time to kick in and you‚Äôre energetic enough to deal with all of the hassles. You can plan ahead of your time by setting due dates for your tasks or sync your task list to Google Calendar so that you know when you need to finish your tasks. After adding your to-do list to calendar, select a specific time slots and reserve them for the tasks.    Aim to limit your schedule to 4-5 priority tasks per day instead of trying to overachieve and eventually let yourself burn out with your own list. Stay focused and committed to your task list and the time block. If you have set 9:30am - 10:30am for tracking the data analysis, you should stick with the schedule no matter what.    Start a new year with a clean slate!   Brace yourself, New Year is coming! You are going to spend the next 365 days with your work being the central of your life, so start your new year right. Hopefully you‚Äôre going to have the best year of your life (and more to come!). We couldn‚Äôt be more excited to be a part of your journey!

        "title": "A Closer Look at Quire Redesigned My Tasks II",
        "excerpt": "   Project management is a complicated and demanding process which often involves so many different tasks and people at the same time.  For years, Quire users write us hundreds of feedback suggesting Quire should have a personal list to dump all the mental clutter into and a place to review all of the tasks that are related to themselves only.    Finally, last week, after a long and meticulous journey, we introduced the brand-new redesigned My Tasks II. The new My Tasks is a default list in Quire that allows you to focus on the right thing in the moment, organize your ongoing projects and get things done in a less stressful way.    Curious about how Quire team is using the new My Tasks II to optimize our workflow? Let‚Äôs get started!     Capture your cluttered tasks and create a personal task list   You might realize often when you‚Äôre multitasking, good ideas come along and you need to write them down. However, you are not sure which project you can add to or you simply don‚Äôt want to waste your time scrolling just to find a specific task list. With the new My Tasks II, your problem is solved!    We introduced a brand new type of task called ‚Äúpersonal task‚Äù. Those tasks are only visible to you and they do not belong to any particular project. Those tasks can be scattered thoughts or just a few words when you‚Äôre brainstorming. For example, late at night when you‚Äôre just about to call it a day, you realize you have to finish writing a memo and send to your boss and your client by tomorrow. With the revamped My Tasks II, just type = to launch My Tasks and type the tasks down and move on.    Adding personal tasks has become more intuitive with Quire. When you are working on different projects and you want to quickly make a note to self, you can use the hotkey m or click + on the upper right corner to add a task directly to My Tasks without leaving your current project.           Later,  you can go back to your own My Tasks and organize those cluttered tasks. The best part is, Quire infinite nested list is also enabled for personal tasks. You can create endless sub-levels for your tasks if necessary.      Organize your task list with Dynamic Sort and Filter      Tip: Use the filter `Project` and choose `None` to view your personal tasks only.  Before with the old version of My Tasks, it was just a sad plain list on the upper left corner to look at. And we don‚Äôt want you to start your day with a sad list. The newly revamped My Tasks II lets you have a more reliable and dynamic list to kickstart your day.    Along with the new My Tasks II, we also introduced two brand new sorting and filtering options: Sort by Project and Filter by Project. You can now see your task lists being grouped neatly into specific categories. Also, in case you‚Äôve missed it, recently we also have the new two-level sorting option so that you can be creative with all of the sorting and filtering.      Tip: Be creative with Quire Dynamic Sort and Filter! You can sort your task list by `Date` then `Project` and filter by `Priority`. Voila! You can also bookmark this filter for future use as well.  The best news is, with Quire users‚Äô suggestions and feedback, we have added the task hierarchy function to My Tasks II. All of the tasks in My Tasks now share the same hierarchical layout with the project task list. Moreover, you can keep your task list in order by rearranging the tasks intuitively with drag-and-drop function whenever you need.      Many Quireans told us how they love the old 3-panel view for My Task. It‚Äôs always a breeze to click a task on My Tasks and view the project respectively in the main panel. With the new My Tasks II, navigation cannot get any more simple. You can simply right-click the task and choose Go to [Project] and the system will take you to the same task in the project. Then you can press = to go back to My Tasks and continue where you left off.    Collaborate and view project members‚Äô progress.   When you are working on a complex project with a lot of team members, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the information maze. Staying on track with your task list is one thing, keeping an eye on your team members‚Äô progress can be very difficult.    With the new My Tasks II, you can click on the member‚Äôs profile and view their task lists (no worries, your personal tasks are still private to you only!). You can even use filter and sort to have a closer look at those tasks your team members are working on.    To make your workflow even more intuitive, you can create a new task in your team members‚Äô My Tasks section to directly assign the task to them as well. Your team member will get the notification about the newly created task.    A smart to-do list that helps you get things done.   We rebuilt Quire My Tasks with the goal to help our users visualize the task lists, plan ahead for future projects and ultimately get things done. My Tasks II is carefully designed to improve your workflow and optimize productivity. It‚Äôs just the early day for My Tasks II (and Quire!) so there are endless possibilities for us to explore. We hope with this update, we can be a part of your successful story to achieve your dreams one day.

        "title": "Quire My Tasks II: Redesign the way you kickstart a day",
        "excerpt": "   Drum roll please! ü•Åü•Åü•Å Today we‚Äôre thrilled to introduce you with the brand-new renovated Quire My Tasks II. Now you can have your own Quire to-do list to keep track of all the tasks that are related to you.    My Tasks is a default task list in Quire. Before, you have to select a project before adding a task. However, with the newly redesigned My Tasks, you can directly add a task to Quire without being specific about the project. Just select Add to My Tasks or use the shortcut m and the newly created task will be added to My Tasks list instead of the project you are working on.    The new My Tasks allows you to capture your ideas and put them in an unorganized folder so that your mind wouldn‚Äôt be too occupied. You can go back to the list in the future to filter out and work on the cluttered tasks that previously caught your attention.   Also, we introduced a new short cut to launch and close My Tasks immediately no matter which project you&#39;re working on. Just hit = and voila, there you go.    What tasks will be included in My Tasks?   My Tasks will include tasks that are assigned to you, created by you without assignees with start or due dates in any project and your personal tasks. Those tasks can belong to a specific project or just be the personal tasks without being assigned to a project.    All of the tasks in My Tasks share the same hierarchical layout with the project task list. Moreover, you can keep your task list in order by rearranging the tasks intuitively with drag-and-drop function whenever you need.   For more information about the new My Tasks, please visit the Getting Started Tutorial.   How can I make the best out of the new My Tasks?   Quickly check out your personal to-do list at a glance   When it comes to project management, getting started is always the hardest part. It is too easy to get lost at the information maze and a lot task list. However, with the revamped My Tasks, you can view the tasks that are relevant to you only, and start from there.    A practical implementation of GTD Method   If you‚Äôre a diehard fan of GTD Method, you already know the first step of this phenomenon organizing method. Don‚Äôt think twice, just list everything out so you can stop feeling overwhelmed with all of the tasks and thoughts. Quire My Tasks II serves as a central Inbox section for you to dump your ideas to and later, you can go back to review the task list and transfer to relevant projects.           One of the best enhancements with Quire My Tasks is the ability to directly complete the task. If the task is just temporary or it‚Äôs your personal task, you don‚Äôt have to transfer it to another project, just work on the task in the My Tasks and complete it when you‚Äôre done.   Keep track of other team members‚Äô workload   A lot of Quireans (yes, that‚Äôs you - Quire users!) have raised the attention to Quire Team about the ability of viewing the tasks of other colleagues in the same organization or project. With the new My Tasks, you can keep track of everyone‚Äôs progress by viewing their tasks list. As for a project manager, being able to know who is doing what is very critical in order to create a smooth and streamlined workflow.    That‚Äôs all for today! We hope you like the new My Tasks! Everything&#39;s coming together because of you and your support! Thank you for being a part of another milestone for Quire!   If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out feedback@quire.io üòÑ   Updated on Nov 27, 2019  ",

        "title": "Quire - Behind the Scenes: The Untold Stories",
        "excerpt": "   Back in 2014, a group of developers had been trying out hundreds of project management software solutions in order to solve the productivity puzzle but left unanswered. The main problem with common project management software is that it involves a very long list, which can backfire on the efficiency in the workplace.    Unwilling to settle for all the complexity, Quire was born as an answer to conquering a big project and achieving your dreams. Maybe you‚Äôre new to Quire or you‚Äôve been a Quirean for a long time, we would like to share with you the journey of Quire.   Today we‚Äôre thrilled to bring you an interview with Tom - the creator of Quire.  As a serial entrepreneur and a software developer, Tom shares with us his insightful tips to deal with software complexity, how to boost team productivity, and more!    To get us started, could you share a bit about the background of Quire and what was going on in the market when Quire launched and what were the goals for differentiation?    We‚Äôre Potix Corporation - a privately held software company that owns and develops ZK framework - the leading Java Web framework.  Along with our journey, from collaboration with Fortune 500 companies down to small businesses, we‚Äôve tried ourselves with a variety of project management software but left unsatisfied.    The common project management tool involves working with a long task list; the interrelationships of tasks are not presented visually nor logically. What‚Äôs worse is that we were forced to digest every detail in a project head on.  Therefore, dealing with a long list in the most logical way has been Quire‚Äôs philosophy ever since.      We created Quire to map out exactly how your mind works. When you face a challenging project, it can get overwhelming if you don‚Äôt know where to start. Quire is designed to break down big ideas to digestible tasks to help you get started step-by-step then achieve the goal eventually. Instead of a plain disorganized to-do list, we introduced an infinite nested task list. Users can use tasks and subtasks to create an endless mind map to illustrate the big picture of a project.    Then when a list grows a bit overwhelming,  we have Kanban board for users to move some of the crucial tasks to focus on for a short period of time. Our Kanban board mirrors exactly how a tangible whiteboard works. Everything is laid out neatly for users to track progress and effortlessly visualize the workflow. You can have different boards for different teams within the same project.     Given your industry experience, what have been the biggest shifts you‚Äôve witnessed over the years in the productivity software space? Can you identify any trends or challenges Quire has had to stay ahead of to remain competitive?    There is always a new productivity software that comes out every now and then. Each software is developed with different approaches. Every productivity software tries to add as many features as possible to their software to deliver the ‚Äúwhole package‚Äù tool for users.    However, it‚Äôs never our intention to make Quire a software that can please everyone. There‚Äôs no perfect solution when it comes to a project management tool. If you don‚Äôt like a tool because it doesn‚Äôt fit your needs, just walk away and pick up another.   At Quire, we believe a good project management software is made for solving one‚Äôs problems, making the impossible missions possible. We don‚Äôt want to create a platform that drives our users crazy because of all the features maze.    Your time comes with a price tag, don‚Äôt waste your time on learning and using a complicated tool. Quire puts together all the fundamental features that a project manager needs to get things done, no more, no less. And the best part is, all of the powerful features are wrapped in the most intuitive and logical user interface.   AI &amp; IFTTT (or, more precisely, application-to-application) are the two features that we‚Äôre considering at this moment. We believe a project management software that integrates with AI &amp; IFTTT will expand the users‚Äô working capacities and boost productivity of the team without increasing stress.     Quire offers a good list of features ‚Äî from streamlined to-do lists and progress trackers to cross-device functionality. Is there an underlying tenet connecting all of your features that you think attracts and retains users? What‚Äôs your personal favorite aspect of Quire to tell users about?    Unlike other kinds of software, users from productivity software market know exactly what they‚Äôre looking for. Every team has a set of required features that they expect to see in a tool. User‚Äôs interface also plays a very important role in the decision making process for a software deployment.    While having all the powerful functionality to help users achieve high levels of productivity,  Quire still successfully keeps a clean and minimalist design, which gets a lot of praise among our users community.    Each of the features in Quire was developed carefully to the details just to give our users the most logical workflow to ease up the tension at work. One of my favorites is the recently released Peekaboo feature. We believe productivity is a continuous process, so in order to keep up with your dynamic workflow, you must not get stuck or burnt out with your long task list.    Quire Peekaboo feature lets you tuck away the tasks that cannot be completed right away for future exploration. So instead of worrying about what to do, you can dive in your task list and actually make progress everyday.     If you had to quantify the #1 benefit Quire delivers to users, what would it be (hours saved through better organization, streamlined workflows, higher productivity rates, ROI, all of the above)?    As a productivity software, of course, the most valuable benefit that Quire delivers to our users is the ability to get things done at the minimum effort. We try not to create another problem while solving an existing problem. Our users come to Quire with the hope of having a software to organize their work and boost productivity.    We think Quire does a very good job at streamlining users‚Äô workflows and saving all of the wasted effort and time in worrying about the project. Instead, with Quire, you can go ahead and start working on your project right away.       Quire doesn‚Äôt aim for adding heavy features and becoming an all-in-one solution. However, when it comes to adding new features, how much of the internal development process and discussions are based around adapting to the newest trend and/or listening to user feedback?    One of the benefits of cloud-based project management software is the central management. We update our system every couple days to create a better experience for our users. Quire is a product-oriented company, which means we focus on how to actually enhance our product.    We have an active community and we receive a lot of feedback and suggestions from our users everyday. We spend a lot of time in listening to the needs of the users then discussing internally on how to best deliver the new feature. Creating a bunch of features isn‚Äôt an impossible mission, however, creating one feature that actually goes well with the existing workflow to become a whole package is another story.    In most cases, we spend more time on thinking about the logic behind a potential feature, than on the how-to implement it.  For example, mostly every productivity tool has Kanban board, but when we decided to add Kanban board to Quire, it took our team nearly 1 year to come up with a different approach that actually solves our users with their productivity problem (streamlining workflow from brain-storming, planning to executing via nested task list and Kanban board).   A lot of our users now really appreciate and love the way Quire allows them to have both of the views for one project instead of pushing them to choose either one.         What‚Äôs on the horizon? Is there anything coming down the pipeline that you‚Äôre personally excited about? Quire users are very excited to know about Quire roadmap.    We realize it‚Äôs impossible to fulfill every demand from our users and we never want to keep adding new irrelevant features to Quire just to have an all-in-one software. We decided to have Open APIs for our users to integrate their most preferable apps/software with Quire, and have a marketplace for our community to help each other to customize Quire.   Timeline, Gantt chart and IFTTT will soon come to Quire as well. We don‚Äôt want Quire to be ‚Äújust another productivity software‚Äù with the same features, that‚Äôs why we take a lot of time in internal discussion and beta test to make sure the new feature will be a breakthrough and go smoothly with the current workflow in Quire.   Besides adding new features to Quire, we also keep reconsidering and refining the existing functionality for better user‚Äôs experience. For example, we‚Äôre working on the 3rd generation of ‚ÄúMy Tasks‚Äù section. We hope the new updates can bring user‚Äôs productivity to another level.    Describe your team ‚Äî is there a company ideology you‚Äôre most proud of, or perhaps, a little-known fact about your team culture/office dynamics that you think contributes to your success as a brand?    Quire is a very dynamic team. We have a very talented developer team with strong knowledge of technology. We always encourage our team members to think outside of the box and come up with new innovative ideas for Quire. We frequently discuss about users‚Äô suggestions and how to enhance Quire.    Every member is inspired to actively use a lot of different tools and share our experiences with the team. We avoid viewing things as Quire developers, instead, our team always tries to walk on users‚Äô shoes. We learn from our users, listen to the market‚Äôs needs and work as a team to deliver value to our community. Users‚Äô positive feedback and suggestions are always the endless inspiration for us to develop Quire.  ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Start Your Dreams on Mars",
        "excerpt": "   Exploring Mars is no longer just a wild dream to human beings anymore. Team Tumbleweed is a group of currently 16 students that is building a wind-driven Mars rover. The team is located at TU Delft in the Netherlands, TU Wien in Austria, and at Stanford University in the US.    The idea is to develop a scouting solution that is able to rapidly explore large areas of Mars‚Äô surface to identify research targets and find landing spots. Tumbleweed is a good mix of engineers, software developers, PR strategists, and business students. The team is currently growing from the core team of 4 people to hopefully around 50 in November 2019.   After several months of using Quire, the team loves to share with us how Quire has supported the whole team in managing their projects and collaborate with the team members from all over the globe.   An Excel File is No Longer Viable for a Dynamic Team Anymore   As the large remote team is coming together in a short time, Tumbleweed immediately faced a challenge with tracking their task list using Excel. The old-fashioned tool like Excel cannot be enough for a dynamic team and soon appeared to be not viable anymore. The team needs a new solution with rather basic functionality and good usability to manage their growing task lists.       Productivity software is such a crowded market and finding an one-size-fits-all solution is simply a mission impossible. Team Tumbleweed has googled for the best task management software and tried several popular solutions such as Trello or Meisertask before they settled for Quire.    ‚ÄúWe used another popular solution for some time but no one really liked it since it forces you to put things on boards and people also were too lazy to look into it often.‚Äù -- Tumbleweed Team    Quire Provides the Exact Features that Our Team Needs - No More, No Less   After a short time of initial trial with Quire, Tumbleweed decides to settle with Quire. ‚Äú[Quire] is the only free tool that had this ‚Äúpremium‚Äù feel to it and wasn‚Äôt overloaded with features we didn‚Äôt need,&#39;&#39; said Tumbleweed Team.   As one of the core values that Quire team shares when we started to develop Quire, trying to please everyone by stuffing as many features as possible into a project management software won‚Äôt do any good for a team. Instead of driving users crazy with the features maze, Quire focuses on creating the set of features that can go well with the existing workflow and deliver a whole package solution that can actually help users to get things done.   Team Tumbleweed also shared with Quire how they love the modern and minimal interface of this tool - just like a clean, well-organized sheet of paper lays out all the information you need. The main panel shows very clearly who to do what and when to meet the deadlines. It is critical for team collaboration to view and track what the other teammates are working on at the moment.       Since Mars exploration is obviously a big project that requires all hands on deck, communication can be very challenging and might backfire on the productivity if not handled carefully. Team Tumbleweed took advantage of Quire nested task list to break down the whole project to digestible tasks, organize in a well-structured hierarchical list, and keep everyone informed with the seamless Slack and Quire integration.     ‚ÄúThank you so much for your work! We have already recommended it to other student groups. Please stick to your philosophy of providing only the most essential features but making those as easy to use as possible. You‚Äôre amazing!‚Äù -- Tumbleweed Team    Quire also allows Team Tumbleweed to keep documents corresponding to a task centralized using Google Drive integration. You just need to log in to Quire, find everything in one central place and waste no time since you never have to search for the deliverables.   Choosing a good project management software that has enough features for the team to get things done yet still maintain a simple and clean minimalist is not an easy mission. Quire team is very happy to join the exciting journey of Team Tumbleweed.  And, we aspire to hear more great stories about Quire‚Äôs role in pursuing your next goals!  ",

        "title": "Be a Hero: Create Your Own App with Quire API",
        "excerpt": "   We are happy to announce the release of version 1.0.0 of our OpenAPI, Quire uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate requests between your app and your users. With OAuth, users can give you access to their Quire content without giving up their passwords.    This means that a user could authorize an app to access data or make changes to their Quire account and services that are exposed by the Quire API. For example, an app could create or delete tasks, post a comment, or alter an assignee, due, tags.   OAuth Application Setup   In order to use Quire API, you‚Äôll need to create an Oauth app.   Create your Quire oauth app   You‚Äôll need to be logged in to your Quire account to create an app.    Go to the Quire developer app console and click on the Create new app button.   Choose the Quire Organization that your app belongs to, the organization members can view/edit all apps belongs to the selected organization.   Give your application a name and Redirect URL, we will discuss the role of the Redirect URL later. For now you can supply the following URL:   http://localhost:3000/callback  Click the Create new app button, your newly created OAuth application will be presented on the developer console page, allowing you to further configure it.     In summary, you should have these three bits of information:    Development Client ID: :wJoMEodI4fSSR54pfNwIuIzLnaJ Development Client Secret: eb8faf4nyd1wbeconw060e9ejui8zg6w8p1hyoex Callback URL: http://localhost:3000/callback      Setup Your Development Environment   Step 1. Configure Your App   Host your application configuration information in you app.    const clientId = &#39;:wJoMEodI4fSSR54pfNwIuIzLnaJ&#39;; const clientSecret = &#39;eb8faf4nyd1wbeconw060e9ejui8zg6w8p1hyoex&#39;; const redirectURI = &#39;http://localhost:3000/callback&#39;;    const authorizationUrl = &#39;https://quire.io/oauth&#39;; const tokenUrl = &#39;https://quire.io/oauth/token&#39;; const apiUrl = &#39;https://quire.io/api&#39;;  Step 2. Redirect User to Authorize App on Quire   Generate an authorization url that you will redirect your users to Quire‚Äôs OAuth endpoint URI. This will show a web page where logged in Quire users can authorize your application to access their content.   Sample URL:    https://quire.io/oauth?client_id=your-client-ID&amp;redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri  An authorization link view example might look like:   var http = require(&#39;http&#39;); var url = require(&#39;url&#39;); var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {      var uri = url.parse(req.url, true);     if (uri.pathname == &#39;/&#39;) {                 //..         } else if (uri.pathname == &quot;/install&quot;) {         var authUrl = authorizationUrl              + &#39;?client_id=&#39; + clientId              + &#39;&amp;redirect_uri=&#39; + encodeURIComponent(redirectURI);         res.writeHead(200, { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/html&#39; });         res.write(              &#39;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#39;              + &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39; + authUrl + &#39;&quot;&gt;Connect Quire&lt;/a&gt;&#39;           + &#39;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;);         res.end();      } else if (uri.pathname == &quot;/callback&quot;) {         //...     } }); server.listen(3000);  The state parameter is a random string used to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. You should randomly generate a character string. It will be passed back to your app, unchanged, in Step 3. Your application should validate this value. Though it is optional, we strongly recommend including this parameter.   Sample URL:    https://quire.io/oauth?client_id=your-client-ID&amp;redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri&amp;state=lpcl9v94z  Step 3. Handle the OAuth 2.0 server response   The OAuth 2.0 server responds to your application&#39;s access request by using the URL specified in the redirect_uri.   If the user approves the access request, then the response contains an authorization code. If the user does not approve the request, the response contains an error message. The authorization code or error message that is returned to the web server appears on the query string, as shown below:   An error response:   http://localhost:3000/callback?error=access_denied  An authorization code response:   http://localhost:3000/callback?code=4/P7q7W91a-oMsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7  A callback example might look like:   //... } else if (uri.pathname == &quot;/callback&quot;) {    var result = uri.query;    var message = &#39;Auth fail&#39;;    if (result[&quot;error_description&quot;] != null) {        message = result[&quot;error_description&quot;];        if (result[&quot;error&quot;] == &#39;access_denied&#39;) {            //display reject message        }        messageView(res, message);    } else if (result[&quot;code&quot;] != null) {        return exchangeAccessToken(result[&quot;code&quot;])        .then(function(data) {             var token = data[&#39;access_token&#39;];             message = token != null ? &#39;Success&#39;: &#39;Fail&#39;;             messageView(res, message);         });    } }  When the user is redirected back to your application redirect_uri, a code and state parameter will also be present in the querystring parameters. The state is your CSRF anti-forgery token to validate the request.   Extract the code and state from the query string parameters. The state may be validated at this point.   A validate example might look like:   } else if (result[&quot;code&quot;] != null) {     if (result[&quot;state&quot;] != stateFromSession(res))         return messageView(res, &#39;invalid state&#39;);                  return exchangeAccessToken(result[&quot;code&quot;])     .then(function(data) {          var token = data[&#39;access_token&#39;];          message = token != null ? &#39;Success&#39;: &#39;Fail&#39;;          messageView(res, message);      }); }  Step 4. Exchange authorization code for access token   Your application needs to make a POST call to the token endpoint with the extracted authorization code and the request parameters in the below.     Parameter Value    grant_type authorization_code   code {your-authorization-code}   client_id {your-client-ID}   client_secret {your-client-secret}    A request an access token example might look like this:   var request = require(&#39;request&#39;); function exchangeAccessToken(code) {     return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){         request.post({             url: tokenUrl,              form: {               grant_type: &#39;authorization_code&#39;,               code: code,               client_id: clientId,               client_secret: clientSecret             }           },            function (error, httpResponse, body) {             if (error) {               return reject(error);             }             resolve(JSON.parse(body))           });     }); }  The access token you receive in response will be a JSON format.    Example Response:   {    &quot;access_token&quot;:&quot;ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,    &quot;token_type&quot;: &quot;bearer&quot;,    &quot;expires_in&quot;:2592000,    &quot;refresh_token&quot;:&quot;REFRESH_TOKEN&quot; }  The token should be kept carefully and permanently since you need it to access every Quire API.   Make calls to the API using the access token   Your app now has an access token that it can be used to make API calls on user&#39;s behalf.   Call the API   Make the API call passing the access token as a bearer token in the header of the request.    An api call example might look like:   function getCurrentUser(token) {     return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){         request.get({             url: apiUrl + &#39;/user/id/me&#39;,              headers: {               &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer &quot; + token             }           },            function (error, httpResponse, body) {             if (error) {               return reject(error);             }             resolve(JSON.parse(body))           });     }); }  Example Response:   {   &quot;email&quot;: &quot;john@gmail.cc&quot;,   &quot;website&quot;: &quot;https://coolwebsites.com&quot;,   &quot;id&quot;: &quot;My_ID&quot;,   &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is *cool*!&quot;,   &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://quire.io/u/My_ID&quot;,   &quot;nameText&quot;: &quot;My Name&quot;,   &quot;nameHtml&quot;: &quot;My Name&quot;,   &quot;descriptionText&quot;: &quot;This is cool!&quot;,   &quot;descriptionHtml&quot;: &quot;This is &lt;i&gt;cool&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;,   &quot;image&quot;: &quot;https://quire.s3.amazonaws.com/oid/image.jpg&quot;,   &quot;iconColor&quot;: &quot;37&quot;,   &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My Name&quot;,   &quot;oid&quot;: &quot;Dyh2YkFcu9uLgLFIeN1kB4Ld&quot; }  Refreshing Tokens   An access token intentionally is meant for short-term use only. This is an important security mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow, the access tokens have an one-hour lifetime by default.   When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned:   {    code: 401,    message: &#39;Invalid or expired token.&#39;  }  Your application will need to refresh the access token.  function refreshToken(refreshToken) {     return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){         request.post({             url: tokenUrl,              form: {               grant_type: &#39;refresh_token&#39;,               refresh_token: refreshToken,               client_id: clientId,               client_secret: clientSecret             }           },            function (error, httpResponse, body) {             if (error) {               return reject(error);             }             resolve(JSON.parse(body))           });     }); }  Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication flow.    We hope by now you already know how to use Quire API! We can&#39;t wait to see the amazing apps that you will build for Quire! üòç  ",

        "title": "8 Best Tips for Remote Teams to Boost Productivity at Virtual Office",
        "excerpt": "   We are living in a fast-paced society where everything needs to be done quickly without any hassles. Nothing kills joy and productivity more than being chained to a desk for 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. Managers have found a better way to boost productivity and save infrastructure cost by supporting remote work for full-time employees. According to OwlLabs research, ‚Äúcompanies that offer remote-friendly options see 25% less turnover than those who do not.‚Äù   Employees are happier when they can choose to work from home or at a rustic coffee shop, no matter if they are night owls or early birds, they have different options to make the schedule work best for their creativity and productivity.    Though it is inevitable that remote teams can deliver many benefits for companies overall, it still remains as a challenge for managers to ensure productivity for the whole team. Given the fact that each team member has a very different work schedule, team collaboration can suffer if not being handled carefully.    We have put together some tips to help entrepreneurs manage high-performing and productive remote teams.    1.  Adopt an effective collaboration tool   It is critical for the whole team to have a platform to share the work and collaborate together other than using email loops and messaging. One of the top challenges for remote teams is to keep track of the progress and streamline workflow with the time and location differences.  A cloud-based project management software is a perfect option to help teams coordinate and collaborate. Everything is laid out neatly within a single platform where anyone can access and be in sync with the whole team.    2. Set a clear agenda   One of the worst nightmares for remote team collaboration is to get lost in the information loop, especially if you are dealing with an international team who speak different languages. Important messages can be easily lost in translation. As an entrepreneur or manager, you should set a clear objective for each project and create different milestones so that your team can easily check in and track the progress.    3. Digitize the workflow   Not only you need a good project management software to keep everyone on the same page, you should digitize every communication channel or file storage system as well. There are tons of productivity apps that guarantee to actually make differences to teamwork efficiency.  By making every information available and accessible with an internet connection, you have saved hundreds of hours for the team to find the note sticking somewhere on the desk or arguing about the project deadlines.    4. Schedule conference calls and video-based coaching regularly   The perk of being a virtual employee is to have a relaxing working environment, but sometimes it can backfire on the productivity. It is very easy to get lost and mess up the whole plan when you cannot run into your supervisor‚Äôs office anytime to ask questions or just turn the chair around to discuss with your teammates. Many remote teams swear by a  good video conference app to enhance their face-to-face communication. Just schedule a weekly or monthly call, get everyone join the session from anywhere and discuss the projects. Even 10 - 15 minutes can make a huge impact on the team productivity.       5. Build the trust among team members   Some people have trust issues, it is completely understandable. But an entrepreneur that wants to embrace a remote workforce cannot have trust issues. There is always uncertainty about whether or not your team members are working or they are actually lying in Hawaii with a glass of Maitai on a Wednesday afternoon. Some remotely working guidelines should be established, such as standard response time, time-tracking tasks, regular updates and reports, etc.    6. Have time for 1:1 review session   It is difficult to manage a team that locates literally everywhere in the world. A company that supports work-from-home culture should really take feedback seriously in order to establish close bonds between team members and provide guidance when needed. Managers should schedule periodical 1:1 review session with the team members (the meeting can be easily conducted with a conference call app) to learn about the concerns or suggestions that might fly under manager radar or give out support when necessary.   7. Data analysis is the key   If you are managing a remote team, chances are sometimes you will find it very challenging to evaluate the workforce performance. Without the face-to-face conversation, monitoring employees‚Äô productivity can be quite tricky. To get deeper insight into worker efficiency, data analysis can help you spot which projects need immediate attention or which employees may need some extra coaching effort.  You can also share the data analysis with the team so that everyone learns more about their productivity and how to improve if necessary.   8. Remove the remote once in a while   Working remotely can sometimes make employees feel isolated. Once in a while, you should get the whole team together and spend quality time to share the work experiences or just having face-to-face conversations. Team collaboration can be greatly benefited with some interactions among team members. It helps build strong relationships, create trust among workers, boost productivity and enhance team adaptation.    Remote team becomes a trend that a lot of enterprises embrace in order to expand their international market. A remote team can be an invaluable asset to the whole company. However, if managers fail to handle the working remotely culture, productivity can suffer and might result in revenue lost. Managers should be the one who glued the team together, and with the above tips, remotely working should be a very relaxing experience.   ",

        "title": "Busy vs. Productive: 5 Tips to Improve Time Management Skills for Project Managers",
        "excerpt": "   2019 has already come down to the last quarter, which means many of you have been busier than ever with all of the annual reports. Regardless of how many extra hours you‚Äôve put in, the to-do list still appears to be never-ending. You started to wonder why you‚Äôre always busy but it doesn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre being productive at work.    Everyone has the same amount of time every day - the same 24 hours no matter who you are and what you‚Äôre doing for a living - you have exactly 24 hours, no more no less. However, many people still complain about ‚Äúhaving too much on my plate‚Äù but ‚Äúso little time to do anything‚Äù while others seem to successfully optimize their schedule to make the most of every day.    The answer is ‚Äútime management‚Äù skill. You don‚Äôt have to work overtime everyday or pull an allnighter every now and then to be productive. Many people only work for exact 8 hours per day and still meet the deadlines. We‚Äôve put together some proven simple tips for you to follow in order to stop being busy and start being productive.    1. Schedule your to do list   Pre-loading your day with a good to-do list and a calendar works like a charm. Start your day with a task that is easy and enjoyable. No one asks you to move a mountain on a Monday morning, and you shouldn‚Äôt ask yourself the same thing. Write down everything you need to accomplish for one week then break down into several digestible to-do lists.    You can integrate your task list to Google Calendar to view what you have to do in a day so that you can get yourself well-prepared. Block off the most productive time in your calendar for some important tasks. No matter what happens, you should always stick to the as-planned schedule.    2. Set priorities for each task   Prioritizing is very important when it comes to agile project management. However, a task list with every task being labeled as ‚Äúhigh priority‚Äù can backfire on your productivity. If you have too many things on your plate, group them by due dates first then start categorizing the priority level from there.    The tasks with the highest priority should always be pinned to the top of the task list. Even if you think every task is equally important, start with the one that holds the biggest consequence if you don‚Äôt complete it. Instead of being freaked out at the long list, just pick up a task and you will get more done eventually.       3. Eliminate distractions   If you‚Äôre terrible at being focused on your work, maybe you can get some help from a productivity app. You can set a reminder on your phone to tell you when to start working on a task, when to take a break or when the task is due.    The Pomodoro is a good time management technique that you should know. You will get a 25-minute interval to get focused and work on your tasks, followed by a 5-minute break. During the ‚Äúfocus state‚Äù, you cannot do anything but focus on your tasks without any hassle.   4. Track progress   One of the key tips to time management is to consistently track your progress. Trust your hunch when you feel like you haven‚Äôt accomplished anything, you‚Äôre probably right. Check your task list to see if you‚Äôve made any progress recently.    It‚Äôs human nature to have limited self-control, but procrastination can be overcome when you do a daily productivity review. If you‚Äôre not sure how to track your work, maybe a project management software or a task management app can help you.   5. Set some boundaries   Don‚Äôt try to be a superhero and squeeze everything into a tight schedule. Excellent time management skills don‚Äôt require you to stress yourself out to overwork. Instead, you should get things done effectively and be productive while still maintaining a good mental health.   When you think you‚Äôre already overloaded with your to do list, start saying no to the irrelevant tasks. You‚Äôre given with that much time, don‚Äôt sacrifice your sanity with a never-ending list. Take time out, get rest, have a life outside your office, etc. A good project manager is the one that knows how to balance between life and job, not a workaholic who is busy all the time.   ",

        "title": "3 Proven Tips on How to Run Effective Meetings with a Digital To Do List",
        "excerpt": "   You may want to ask yourself these two questions: ‚ÄúHow much time do I spend on meetings this week?‚Äù and ‚ÄúAre my business meetings effective?‚Äù If you think those meetings suck and they‚Äôre wasting your time, well, you‚Äôre not alone.    According to a research on Harvard Business Review about quantifying the actual cost of meetings to your company, due to the ripple effect, one weekly meeting accounts for 7,000 hours a year and a company will spend approximately total 300,000 hours a year on just meetings only.    Time is money, but there is no money can buy back the time that you‚Äôve spent. Moreover, the abundance of pointless and dreadful meetings will leave negative feelings among all of the employees, not to mention the unnecessary confusion that it may create after the meetings.   It‚Äôs time to stop the meeting madness and seek for improvement from another angle: use a project management software or to do list app as a tool to combat dreadful meetings instead of the traditional approach. We‚Äôve put together some tips for running effective meetings for you.   Tip #1: Set a clear objective      An efficient meeting must serve a defined and specific goal. You cannot invite people over and waste their time for nothing.  Setting a clear objective for the meeting can also help you track progress and its efficiency.    The New York Times has pointed out that ‚Äúthe agenda provides a compass for the conversation‚Äù, so if you don‚Äôt want the attendees to leave the meeting without a clue about what just happened, it might be best to clearly state the meeting‚Äôs objective in the invitation before sending it out.       You can prepare a to do list that contains every topic that you want to cover as a meeting agenda. Be as specific as possible and keep everything simple and straight to the point. With your list, try to add details or attach attachments to the item that requires to be discussed further.   Tip #2: Stick to the schedule and get focused      Nothing is more annoying than being in a meeting that is dragged longer than expected and everything seems irrelevant.  Given the to do list that has been prepared beforehand, the meeting should be held accordingly to each task on the list and avoid the impromptu discussion that might destroy the agenda.    Taking notes during the meeting can be just as important. If a task is time-sensitive, add start dates and due dates in order to track the schedule and control the deadlines in the future. Get creative with your task list, for example, you can add tags to each task for better management or directly cue the responsible personnel by assigning the task to them.       It is very easy to doze off and get distracted with the long list, especially during a several-hour meeting. If you never heard of Kanban board, now is a good time to learn more about this magical board. Kanban board provides a focused zone where you and your team can get focused on a few crucial tasks for a short period of time.    Tip #3: Follow up      No matter if it is a virtual meeting or a monthly board meeting, follow up is the key to keep track with what will happen after the meeting. To reduce the risk of pointless meetings, managers can check the reports to view the progress of a project at anytime and leave comments when necessary.    Don‚Äôt wait until the next meeting to ask for the progress. Check in with the team members or person-in-charge frequently to evaluate the whole project‚Äôs progress. Communication is the key to team collaboration. Sometimes, making adjustments and planning ahead of time are very important to ensure the task is underway.   Stop wasting your life on the meeting madness.   We spend at least 8 hours/day at work, that accounts for one-third of your time for a day. Stop wasting your precious time on the meetings that only suck the life out of you. A good to do list may not be enough to run an effective meeting, however, it‚Äôs a good start. Furthermore, if you use a collaboration or project management tool, you can even avoid certain kinds of meetings, the ones that only need to be held for progress tracking. Time is money, don‚Äôt waste your company‚Äôs tremendous resources on pointless meetings.   ",

        "title": "7 Productivity Tips to Avoid Burnout at Work",
        "excerpt": "   Admit this, everyone has a breaking point at work. No matter how much you love your job or enjoy working with your teammates, there will be times that exhaustion and stress prevail then a sense of defeat sets in. It‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault, you have the right to feel unmotivated and drained from time to time.     On May 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified burnout as a legitimate ‚Äúoccupational phenomenon‚Äù mental syndrome. The constant stress, negative feelings, physical and emotional fatigue at work has now become a serious problem that threatens job performance and costs your business. In the long run, burnout can cause depression among employees and have some severe effect on mental health.     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to prepare and prevent than it is to repair and repent.‚Äù - Ezra Taft Benson    When realizing some burnout symptoms,  you can start making some adjustments to the way you‚Äôre doing your job. Here are some proven effective tips to avoid getting burned out at workplace.    Tip #1: Acknowledge your breaking point.   Even though you‚Äôre a chronic workaholic, you should set your own boundaries. Being an overachiever can cost you your productivity in the long run. Responsibility can create stress and wear you down if you are taking on more than your capacity. Overwhelming workload has also been proven to create nervous breakdown and physical fatigue.    It‚Äôs not easy to say ‚Äúno‚Äù, at first. However, if you want to stay focused and energetic, you have to slow down and choose your tasks wisely. There‚Äôs no point in trying to be a superhero at work while it does nothing other than draining your own energy and taking away your excitement.    Tip #2: Create an effective to do list and commit to it.   We are almost 20 years into the twenty-first century, it‚Äôs not surprising if your productivity suffers because you still plan things in your head and try to remember every single to-dos without making a physical list. There are hundreds of to do list apps that you can choose from beside paper and pen.    A good to do list app can help you consolidate all of your tasks in one place. You should be very specific and organized with your list in order to commit to the list easier. You can set priorities, track your progress and carry out your tasks in a timely manner. With an effective and practical to do list, you can get more done instead of worrying if you‚Äôve missed one or two tasks.    Moreover, planning ahead can help you reduce unnecessary stress and evaluate your workload. If you experience exhaustion with your to do list, maybe it‚Äôs a good time to unplug some of the tasks in the list.    Tip #3: Deploy a good productivity method.   If you‚Äôre a procrastinator who always get stressed out because of your own to do list, it‚Äôs critical for you to commit to a productivity method. One of the most common productivity methods that thousands of project managers swear by is Getting Things Done (GTD) by David Allen. With GTD method, you can plan out each step in advance in order to reduce unnecessary stress.    You can integrate the GTD method with your preferable project management app to get more done. By consistently working on single to-do until you‚Äôve checked off all the tasks in the list, you will not be stressed out by all of the distractions.     Tip #4: Practice KonMari Method at work.   Marie Kondo is a guru when it comes to decluttering and cleaning method. You may have heard of the word ‚Äúspark joy‚Äù over and over again and you‚Äôve successfully KonMari‚Äôd your house and your closet. But how about your work and your task list?    The core value of the phenomenal KonMari method is to deliberately and mindfully choose the things that you want to keep in your life. You should start with your workspace by decluttering your folder cabinet and digital mailbox. An inbox filled with emails can trigger stress and emotional burnout in the long run, so it‚Äôs better for your mental health that you have a working system that helps you declutter those physical and emotional distractions.    Tip #5: Meditate or work out.   Taking breaks and doing some stretching exercises once in a while during work hours can really help you relieve stress and anxiety. You can also practice meditation at least twice a week to flush out toxins and gain positive energy.    Sitting at your desk for long hours can create physical pain and emotional exhaustion that cause burnout. Stop your mind from worrying about your job and start doing some simple exercises.    Tip #6: Ask if you need help.   There‚Äôs no shame to ask for help from others - it will not make people think less of you. Remember no one can be good at everything and sometimes team collaboration is the key to a business‚Äô success.    Choose a good collaborative platform or tool to enhance team performance and optimize the workflow. If you want to prevent burnout, let the stress out before it builds up and backfires on your work productivity.    Tip #7: If nothing works, take time out.   If you‚Äôve done everything in the list and you still feel exhausted and stressed, maybe it‚Äôs a good time to take a step back and have a break for yourself.  You‚Äôve done everything you could to deal with burnout at work but now the pressure officially exceeds your ability to cope. It‚Äôs okay to take time out.    Rome wasn‚Äôt built in one day, so is your career path. You will achieve all of your goals and your dreams eventually, it‚Äôs nothing wrong with putting yourself first and taking care of your health for now.    Burnout is an epidemic in the working culture and it has to be taken seriously. Preventing burnout at work doesn‚Äôt have to be rocket science. You can just follow the above simple steps to improve job performance without overloading your stress level.    Relax, the world will still be there tomorrow! G&#39;luck! üòä  ",

        "title": "Set Up GTD Method in Quire to Live a Stress-free Life",
        "excerpt": "   Almost two decades after the best-selling book by David Allen first published, Getting Things Done (GTD) still remains to be one of the most popular productivity methods that is trusted by thousands of project managers.    Let‚Äôs face it - everyone is procrastinators! At least once in your life, you postpone something for later and soon regret that decision. No worries, we‚Äôre all the same here. When GTD method is first introduced to the public, it immediately became the phenomenal productivity hack that a lot of people swear by. The core value of GTD method is that instead of worrying about the tasks you should have done, it encourages you to actually get things done.   r/explainlikeimfive: What is GTD method?   The GTD method is a way to organize, categorize, plan and execute your tasks. Many people discussed and argued whether GTD methodology is really efficient given its complexity. However, as straightforward as it is, GTD is set up to help you answer one question ‚ÄúWhen to do what?‚Äù.    You‚Äôre in charge of choosing which task to be worked on first and which task to be put aside for later. With GTD method, you can plan out each step in advance in order to reduce unnecessary stress. You don‚Äôt have too much information in your mind anymore, you can start with a clean slate and working on your job instead of thinking about what you have to do.   The GTD method lays out 5 steps to achieve your goal without stressing yourself out.        Capture: Write down everything in your mind, every task you have to do. Don‚Äôt think twice, just list everything out. Clarify: Process the list and decide which task should be done first or required immediate attention. Organize: Add due dates, delegate for others, build a reference file, etc. Basically, you put everything to where they belong to. Review: Review your task list frequently to see if it needs to be updated or revised. Engage: Start doing!   Now you already have an idea of how GTD method works, let‚Äôs go to the next step (the best step) to see how Quire comes in to rescue you from the tension of having too much to do and not knowing where to start.    Aligning Quire with GTD Method   Being a rising star among the best project management software, Quire lets you achieve your dreams by breaking them down into small doable tasks then work toward your goal. Sounds familiar? Quire shares the core value with GTD in terms of not pushing users to the edge with overwhelming goals, instead you should consistently work on your to-dos then eventually one day, you‚Äôll finish what you‚Äôve started.   No matter if you‚Äôre a new to Quire or you‚Äôve been a Quire diehard fan for years, chances are you haven‚Äôt thought of implementing GTD method into Quire (if you have done that already, kudos to you! üòÜ).    Though David Allen introduced GTD method to be worked with pen and paper, along with the development of modern society, everyone is trying to find the best way to implement GTD to digital lifestyle. We have put together several features of Quire that can be aligned perfectly with 5 steps of GTD method.    Step 1 - Capture: Nested task list      The first rule of GTD method is to have a blank mind and a clean plate. With Quire My Tasks, you can dump all of your tangled thoughts and put them into a list. Quire My Tasks lets you have an infinite list to store your cluttered tasks. Later you can come back and revisit your personal task list so that you can transfer or start working on them then complete the task list altogether.   Step 2 - Clarify: Add assignees, descriptions, transfer, comments      GTD asks you one question here: ‚ÄúIs this task actionable now?‚Äù. If yes, the next question would be ‚ÄúWould it take less than 2 minutes to complete the task‚Äù. If it does, then you have to do it right away.    If the tasks require more than 2 actions to finish, you might have to transfer them into a new list. At Quire, you can easily move a group of tasks from one project to another in just seconds. And if you bookmark the new project, you can easily switch between projects to keep track of everything.   If you‚Äôre not the one who will be responsible for the tasks, you can delegate them for others. Quire lets you assign the task to one or more assignees, even to a team!    Step 3 - Organize: Add tags, Due dates, Priority, Peekaboo      David Allen suggests to categorize all of the actionable tasks at this step. The key here is to put the right thing to the right place. Luckily with Quire, we have Peekaboo, Due dates and Tags features to let you fulfill this step.    The golden rule of thumb for this step is to well-manage your list. Never underestimate how a plain and disorganized to do list can destroy your productivity, GTD method lets you go through your list and put more contexts to the list for better management.    Quire lets you assign tags, due and start dates and priority to a task. With all the details, you can have the big picture of your project and effortlessly track the progress.   If you want to postpone the tasks for future exploration or you just want those tasks to serve as reference list only, Quire Peekaboo feature lets you to tuck away all of the distractions so that you can focus only on the things that need your immediate attention. The idea is to move forward with your task list, rather than getting stuck on a particular step.   Step 4 - Reflect: Overview, Report      It is critical for a GTD practitioner to reflect on the progress and make the changes accordingly. You have to review frequently to know how far you‚Äôre from the goal.   Luckily, Quire has made the reflect process easier than ever with the exceptional overview reports. This view includes charts, graphs, summaries and recent activities that show you how much has been done, how much needs to be done, etc.   You need to review your next action list (different projects), waiting for list (Peekaboo list), upcoming calendar (Calendar integration). If there are some tasks that are no longer relevant, delete them for a cleaner task list.   Step 5 - Engage: Kanban Board, My Task      No more procrastination! No more excuses! We hope at this step, you already know what you have to do now! Take action on your task list and achieve your dreams!    You can select several tasks that need your immediate attention and move them to Kanban board. By doing this, instead of looking at a long list (that sometimes may cause distraction), you can just focus on a flat board with all of the tasks that are beautifully laid out and ready to be worked on.    Quire Kanban board also provides swimlane view for you. Just sort all of your tasks by tags or due dates or assignees and voila, a swimlane is effortlessly created and ready to be dove in!    If you‚Äôre working on a project with multiple assignees and contributors, Quire My Task section will be very handy for you to view all of your tasks from different projects and organizations.    Is GTD Method a master key to open any door?   It‚Äôs undeniable that GTD is one of the best productivity methods. You have to be committed to every step of the way to actually get more done. GTD helps you maximize your resources allocation, clear your mind, focus on the important things only.    However, as we always say, there‚Äôs no perfect solution. Quire and GTD may be a powerful duo to help you boost your productivity and achieve your goals, but it‚Äôs also up to you and how you want to digest your task list. Let‚Äôs wrap up with a very cliche saying that everything is possible, you just need to find a suitable tool and a good method to get you started on your dream!   ",

        "excerpt": "   It&#39;s a Monday morning, you‚Äôre sitting at your desk trying to recover from your weekend while waiting for the morning caffeine to kick in. You are browsing your task list for the week and suddenly you feel defeated and discouraged by the never-ending list. Well, Monday doesn‚Äôt suck, you just don‚Äôt know how to organize your work yet. And we‚Äôre here to rescue you from the Monday blues.    Researchers have pointed out that incomplete tasks can trigger stress - especially at workplace. Trying to combat with an overwhelming list with thousands of unfinished to-dos can drain energy, make you lose motivation and get tired easily. Sometimes, listing out everything you need to do does more harm than good. Rather than trying to be an overachieving superhero, how about just be an ordinary person with an effective working method?    Years ago, when David Allen first introduced Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology in his book, it immediately became a phenomenon all over the world. Basically, GTD is a productivity method that helps you organize, optimize productivity, reduce stress and save your precious time. The key to GTD is an open loop that includes everything.    In contrast to the myth, GTD doesn‚Äôt aim to complete the tasks right away. Instead, the goal is to continuously work to accomplish daily goals and eventually, one day you will check off all of the tasks on the list.    Where do all the incomplete tasks go?      The idea of GTD methodology is to have a place for you to store all the tasks that are not required immediate attention and action. David Allen used the term ‚ÄúSomeday/Maybe‚Äù for all the tasks that are impossible to move on at the present but you cannot ignore them completely. As you go through the tasks list, you can determine which tasks can be pushed back and revisited in the future.    At Quire, we realize it‚Äôs important to keep going forward with your goal instead of getting distracted or pressured by the unrelated tasks. We recently introduced a powerful feature that has the cutest name ever - Peekaboo. When your list grows a tad overwhelming, you can pick several tasks that are not actionable at the moment or can be worked on in the near future and peekaboo them, meaning moving to a separate folder that will not bother you anymore.    The peekaboo folder will remain inactive until you visit and pick up on the peekaboo-ed tasks that you want to start working on. We also allow you to set a specific time for the tasks to reshow on the active list so that you will not forget about their existence. The philosophy behind is that you still have to complete them eventually - just not now - so you can buy some more time to work on something more important.    It‚Äôs all about you and how you would like to digest your task list. You choose which tasks to keep and which tasks should be peekaboo-ed for future exploration. You decide when to pick up on what you‚Äôve left off. You will get reminded about the tasks that you peekaboo-ed so you will never actually forget about them and miss the deadlines.    Peekaboo + Kanban Board + Nested Task List = Fantastic Three      Several years ago, we introduced Kanban board and you all love it. At that time, we explained Kanban board will help you focus and execute the assignments that matter the most at the moment while a nested task list is good for planning and brainstorming. You may ask, so what‚Äôs the difference between a Kanban board and Peekaboo folder?   Well, everything you know about Kanban board is correct! Basically, Kanban board is made for the tasks that require immediate action whilst Peekaboo folder is for the postponed tasks. You can think of a task that needs to be done someday, not today.  Sooner or later, you have to work on the tasks that you‚Äôve peekaboo-ed, but not right now, not at this moment.    David Allen has explained why sometimes setting the pending status to a task can unleash the flow of your creative thinking. You don‚Äôt have to worry about too many things at once. Your mind capacity will not be overloaded. You can work on everything that goes smoothly and let the obstacles disappear for a while so it won‚Äôt bother you.    Let‚Äôs say you have a list of everything you need to do for a Charity Campaign.       There are several tasks that need to be worked on in the upcoming weeks, so you move them to a board.       There are several tasks that you have to do eventually, but not now, and you don‚Äôt want those tasks to distract you and your workflow.       So you can select those tasks and peekaboo them.   You can set the time for these tasks to reappear again on your list so you can get your attention to them. Or if those tasks are meant for reference only, you can just leave them in the peekaboo folder.    Peekaboo! Work hard but never forget to have fun!   We always hope Quire is not only a platform for you to organize your work and boost up the productivity, Quire should also be a tool to inspire you everyday!    Follow your passion, love your job and you will never have to work another day in your life! We hope you all have fun with Quire!

        "title": "Top 3 Productivity Tips With Online To Do List Software",
        "excerpt": "   In a fiercely competitive digital landscape, great project management is a vital skill for teams and individuals alike. Disorganization and inefficiency can devastate the most promising teams and projects.   There is certainly no shortage of project management tools offering solutions to this challenge. One such grouping of tools is generally referred to as online to do list software. To do list software primarily takes a checklist approach to task management and productivity.   Whether you‚Äôve tried a to do list method, or are considering doing so, here are three crucial and interrelated tips to know about.   Online To Do List Software Productivity Tip #1: Be Specific   Break big projects and ideas into small tasks   New York Times bestseller Charles Duhigg said in his book The Most Effective Way to Create a To-Do List, ‚Äú[We should] take a big ambition and break it into objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and with a Timeline.‚Äù   A to do list which is too generic can lead to scope creep, missed deadlines, and frustration. An overwhelming to do list causes more stress than a simple note with multiple bullet points.   Many of us can relate to the ‚ÄúWhere do I start?‚Äù sensation of looking at generic to do list. Figuring out which tasks have priority and attempting to, mentally, break them down into a logical order of subtasks has a way of paralyzing productivity.         When task lists get out of control. Anyone else want to take another coffee break?  Besides wrecking productivity, the lack of specificity in a to do checklist can have the effect of making a disciplined and hardworking person feel like a procrastinator. What a rough way to start the day: feeling like a lazy person and wasting precious mental energy trying to wade through vague to do list tasks.   The secret is to break a project down into its smallest, most actionable parts. ‚ÄúPublish a book‚Äù is too vague, ‚ÄúStart writing chapter one‚Äù is more actionable.    To do lists which are too generic can lead to scope creep, missed deadlines, and frustration.    Online To Do List Software Productivity Tip #2: Prioritize and Filter   Stay sane by prioritizing and organizing to do list tasks   One potential pitfall of online to do list software is task overload. Checklists can become overwhelming and hinder productivity. The granularity is great, but the problem becomes the mountain of actionable tasks, this is the opposite problem of vague, generic tasks. When faced with a list of countless tasks, where should one even begin?   Become a productivity master with online to do list prioritizing, filtering and tagging   Nested to do list views are a wonderful way to capture actionable project tasks. A productive team will capture these requirements in great detail, but they won‚Äôt stop there. Team members need a way to make clear sense of the tasks. Great to do list software provides numerous, powerful ways to create clarity and organize. Look for a solution which incorporates the following features:    A view of today‚Äôs tasks only The ability to tag and filter tasks, so you can stay focused and leave out distractions Simple prioritization (ie: urgent, high, medium, low) The ability to assign a task to the people responsible for it, even if they are outside of your organization A powerful and instant search tool The ability to see tasks from multiple projects, all in one place   Software with sophisticated organizational controls enables you to manage tasks with precision, preventing to do list paralysis. Paired with customizable notifications and reminders, there‚Äôs a lot to love about the visual task hierarchy model.   Online To Do List Software Productivity Tip #3: Team Up   Collaborate and conquer   Rarely do tasks divide up neatly. Many modern technologists have overlapping skill sets and shared assignments. It‚Äôs a great idea to have shared task lists.   Perhaps a task like ‚ÄúInstall Bootstrap‚Äù requires multiple team members. No problem, create a parent task ‚ÄúInstall Bootstrap‚Äù and then dish out some relevant subtasks to your IT, Developers, and designers.   Not only is this an effective way to organize work, shared tasks tend to encourage team members and boost morale. Team members feel less isolated and are excited to help achieve a common goal. Who doesn‚Äôt like to see awesome coworkers checking off progress on an ambitious requirement?         Quire uses live updates, so team members can see comments and modifications instantly. Every task supports comments, attachments, duplication, and even merging so you can spend your time achieving big ideas.  Besides team collaborations, there is often the need to collaborate with outside parties. At larger organizations, assigning tasks across departments or working with clients can be a real nightmare:    You: ‚ÄúGreat meeting everyone. We have a clear list of action items, I‚Äôll add them to our to do list software.‚Äù Stakeholder 1: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard of that software. Is it going to require me to sign up?‚Äù External client: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have that software.‚Äù   To solve scenarios like this, look for a to do list software which allows you to share tasks with external parties, including the ability to share a private or public project URL‚Äîwithout requiring sign ups.   Finally, to control access, grant different authorities to different members of your projects.         Share these online to do list tips or save them for future reference with this handy graphic.  Summary   At Quire, we think our project management solution has the right features to boost productivity and elegantly manage tasks. While it‚Äôs much more than an online to do list, we pride ourselves on providing all you need: no more, no less. We think you‚Äôll love the simplicity, and find Quire intuitive and easy to use.  ",

        "title": "Quire Mobile 3.0: Kanban Board comes to Mobile App",
        "excerpt": "   Hello Quire squad, we have some great news for all of you! One of the long-awaited features that all of our users have been requesting has come to life. Today we are super excited that we have brought our famous Kanban Board to both Android and iOS App.                  We both know how you all love to use the nested task list to dump your ideas and organize them into a hierarchical order. Now Mobile users, you can get in motion and have a jumpstart with your project using Quire Kanban Board.    Why Kanban board?   If you‚Äôre a Quire Expert, you already know how Kanban Board helps you execute your project! And the ones who are new onboard, it‚Äôs okay, using our Kanban Board is just as easy as our nested task list!    The basic idea of Kanban board is to select several crucial tasks from your long nested list and move them to a board, so that for a short time you can get all of your attention to those specific tasks only. Since everything is laid straightforward in a board with columns, you can easily visualize your workflow.    Think of every task as a sticky note and your board as a blackboard - you can drag and drop to move the tasks across columns through every stage. You can also add new tasks to increase the workload and track the progress of what you have been doing.         Did you know that we also have ‚Äúswimlane‚Äù in our Kanban board? No, it‚Äôs not the real swimlane. It‚Äôs the figurative flow that shows in Quire Kanban board by using either filter or sort feature. You can view related tasks in sorted order, which helps you focus more on what matters to you.    For example, you can choose ‚ÄúSort by Assignee‚Äù to view all the tasks that are grouped by each assignee to get a hold of who is responsible for what.    Nested Task List Teams Up With Kanban Board          You may ask why you need both of the working modes, why not only task list or Kanban board like other project management solutions? At Quire, we believe the sky‚Äôs the limit as long as you break your challenging goal into attainable tasks and achieve them one-by-one.    Quire task list with the hierarchical structure allows you to brainstorm and plan ahead for your projects. On the other hand, Quire Kanban board is for execution and progress tracking. The best thing with Quire is, you can switch between nested task list and Kanban board at any time to get the best of both worlds.   We always wish to help everyone achieve their dreams. Don‚Äôt let anyone stop you from fulfilling your dream. We hope Quire can give you a little push to move closer to your dream üòÉ    Have fun and enjoy Quire!

        "title": "Dream Chasers: How does a Silicon Valley NPO coordinate with 400 volunteers?",
        "excerpt": "   ZaiGeZaiGu (ËºâÊ≠åÂú®Ë∞∑), or ZGZG in short, is a project of Community Builder Toolbox, Inc. - US IRS registered Non-profit Organization (NPO) and also a Chinese volunteer community which originates from Google at Mountain View, CA, in 2014.    They organize three events every year, Chinese New Year Gala (2500+ audiences, 100+ volunteers involved), Singing Contest (500+ audiences, 100+ volunteers involved), Chinese Culture Fair (1800+ visitors, 100+ volunteers involved).   Realizing that the volunteer project&#39;s scale and complexity have outgrown beyond a regular spreadsheet can track, ZGZG signed up for a Quire account with the hope to find a tool that helps them organize their tasks.    They share with us how ZGZG uses Quire to track tasks and boost productivity across their community.   When a simple spreadsheet is no longer enough for large scale task management   Starting with a volunteer community in Google, now ZGZG grows beyond Google employees and consists of 400+ high tech employees, university students, early tech company founders, etc. in the Silicon Valley.    As their organization keeps growing, ‚ÄúGoogle Sheets and Docs become harder and harder for us to do task tracking, even for those tech savvy volunteers who &quot;know Google Sheets from inside out&quot;, have felt the need of migrating from Sheets to a separate project management tool, such as Quire‚Äù, commented Victor Zhou.    Besides, their community needs to track which volunteer completed what kind of tasks so that they can give the corresponding benefits and reimbursements to them, as a reward system.   As ZGZG leaders were looking for an alternative to Google Sheets, they‚Äôve tried many other solutions such as Jira, Pivotal, ClickUp, Monday or OpenProjects, however, ‚ÄúJira is too complicated and the learning curve seems to be steep, whilst Google sheets is not designed for task tracking, though we can do that with the powerful AppScript integrated in sheets, but there are no guarantees in stability and customer service support.‚Äù stated ZGZG.          Simplicity is the answer when it comes to a good project management tool   There is no such thing as a perfect project management software. There is only the ‚Äúright‚Äù one that can meet most of your needs and be the solution that helps you ease up your workload.    Since there are more than 400 volunteers across ZGZG community, implementing a new software can be a real challenge.   In the past, when ZGZG tried Jira, they have encountered resistance from their volunteers. ‚ÄúThe most important reason why we are reluctant to use Jira is that several teammates once spent around 1 hour to learn Jira but still don‚Äôt know how to use it to track tasks,‚Äù said Sunny Song, a volunteer from ZGZG.    After volunteers recommend against Jira, ZGZG carefully examined another ‚Äúmore simple‚Äù project management software, and they found Quire on Google search with the key word ‚Äútask tracking tool‚Äù.    After a short time of initial trial, ZGZG started to officially get their teams on board with Quire about 3 months ago.  And their team loved it.     ‚ÄúWe adopted Quire in this quarter and really love its compact UI and layered-tasks management features.  Most tasks turn-around-time are very short. Quire has increased our productivity and made everything organized and easy to track.‚Äù  -- Victor Zhou and Sunny Song     There are some reasons that make Quire outweigh its competitors, and here is what ZGZG has to say about Quire.     Easy to use: It requires little to no effort to learn how to use Quire. The software is very straightforward, intuitive and lightweight. You don‚Äôt have to spend any of your budget on the learning cost. Also, onboarding new members cannot get any easier - just adding their emails and you can start collaborating with your teammates!  Completed features list: Quire enables users to customize the task list based on their needs. ZGZG loves tags, multiple assignees (this is the dealbreaker feature for ZGZG), layered tasks management, project duplication, filter, email notifications to assignees, task priority, task descriptions and comments.   Integration: Quire has the option to integrate with Slack, which ZGZG heavily uses on a daily basis.  Public view: Since ZGZG is thrive for transparency, they really appreciate that Quire project could be configured to be viewed publicly.   Cloud-based data storage: Since ZGZG‚Äôs volunteers are from many countries, it‚Äôs critical to have a secured platform to store all of their works. Say goodbye to those emails with attachments that easily get lost in your mailbox. Everything is done online and stored safely, you can work on your projects anytime anywhere.   Real-time collaboration: Quire allows ZGZG to interact with their volunteers quickly on live meetings.  Intuitive UX: From a tech savvy to a person who doesn‚Äôt know much about software, all fall in love with Quire&#39;s &quot;click to add a task&quot; simple UX flow without training.   Export to JSON: Availability to download all tasks in JSON helps ZGZG analyze their productivity afterwards.     ‚ÄúWe ZGZG highly recommend Quire to any other volunteer-based projects and organizations like us.&quot;    It‚Äôs about time that every organization should realize that a conventional flat to-do list or a Google Sheet file does more harm than good to their productivity.    A project at work should not be treated as a laundry list for daily chores. Quire is an essential software to deal with project management by breaking down big ideas to small and achievable tasks.    We seek to bring you a stable and stress-free platform to keep track of your work. Everyone on your organization will be kept in the same loop. No more overdue projects or overwhelming to-do list.    ZGZG is such an inspirational example of how a simple project management software can drive your whole community to success. And, this is the reason why we developed Quire - to help you walk your dream home.   ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Making a Safer and Cleaner Space Environment",
        "excerpt": "   Space pollution is indeed a growing problem, but may not be so obvious or visible to people on earth. Alexandre de Villardi de Montlaur and his team are among scientists and engineers trying to solve this problem. Alexandre, coordinator of the most significant project, the ECE3SAT project at ECE Paris, shares with us on how Quire has supported his team in designing a deboriting satellite that seeks to resolve this growing issue.    Not so obvious, but persistent problem.   As more and more rockets are launched into the air, the accumulation of debris has increased over the years. And, we may not realize the catastrophic damage a tiny debris, smaller than a dime, could cause towards shuttles and the crew‚Äôs safety. It is a risk that is as dangerous as the failure of the shuttle‚Äôs main engine. And, ‚ÄúCurrently, about 20,000 debris larger than a tennis ball and millions of debris, less than 1 cm, orbiting at 28,000 km/h [are present in space]‚Äù comments Alexandre. And, it definitely poses a threat not only to the ‚ÄúInternational Space Station (ISS) and telecommunications in orbit,‚Äù but also to the safety of our Astronauts.   Alexandre, senior, specializing in Aeronautical Embedded System at ECE Paris Graduate School of Engineering, aims at reducing the amount of debris floating in space and lessening the dangers it poses. And, he precisely depicts how Quire has aided the team considerably while implementing this deorbiting satellite.   Alexandre and his team of 30 have been delegated to develop 5 different modules that were significant to the design of the CubeSat. One module includes the ADCS, which controls the rotation and orientation of the satellite. Another is the EPS, the energy power supply, which uses sunlight as a source of energy. Then, there‚Äôs the OBC, an on-board computer that operates the coordination and communication within the satellite. And the TCS, which transmits data back and forth from Earth. As well as an EDT, an ElectroDynamic Tether performed by Alexandre himself, to help reduce the deorbiting time from years to months.     This unique deorbiting system and overall project is very complex, and encompasses many challenges to perform and implement. And, because this huge project consists of much planning, structuring and sharing relevant information, etc. it needs an efficient and intuitive tool. As Alexandre and his team browsed through the abundant resources available, they could not settle on any one of them because ‚Äúall the sites [they] visited unnecessarily complicated the use of their sites for no reason‚Äù stated Alexandre and ‚Äúit would take at least several hours to become completely familiar with the tools‚Ä¶.‚Äù      ‚ÄúNo one has much time to lose, time can be used on the benefits of the project‚Ä¶‚Äù  -- Alexandre de Villardi de Montlaur    Intuitive simplicity and the ergonomics of a nested list.   Without the proper tool to keep tasks straight, there were constant obstacles. However, after coming acquainted with Quire, they overcame barriers and proceeded with implementing their goal. Because of Quire‚Äôs user-friendly interface and clean design, it truly fitted their planning needs and overall project management goals. What truly impressed Alexandre and the team is ‚ÄúQuire‚Äôs ergonomics and intuitive simplicity,‚Äù and the ability to attach and share important documents and files from Drives. As a result, overall communication has been enhanced. Limitations definitely do exist when relaying information amongst large groups and impede action, but with Quire, everything stays organized and everyone has the necessary information and resources available right at their disposal.    For challenging projects, you can break down ideas into chunks, and further into small, bite-sized pieces. What you then get is a well-structured, well-planned hierarchical actionable list of tasks and subtasks. When each item has been divided into smaller and smaller steps, you have a nicely laid-out plan ready for action. In our opinion, ‚Äúnested to do list‚Äù is good for planning a project. It organizes your projects and lets you see the big picture. With a heterogeneous mixture of items to do, Alexandre and his team can organize a task list and add as many subtasks as needed with Quire‚Äôs unlimited level of hierarchical task. And, assign those tasks to the respective members, which makes things rather less complicated. In turn, providing extra time and focus on the project itself.   Working hand in hand with Quire!   The benefits of working on a clean list, without the extraneous clutter, help keeps their attention and aim on the goal. When utilizing Quire, Alexandre and his team gains a clear and quick overview of statuses and members‚Äô progresses. And, everyone stays on the same page. To their advantage, they operate on a more smooth and efficient plane.    After gaining insight from Alexandre and his team, we were pleased to hear how Quire has helped young generations with overcoming challenging feats in future technological advances. It is our goal to help dream chasers tackle major challenges and actualize their dreams. We seek to continue in making a difference for a better world. And, we aspire to hear more great stories about Quire‚Äôs role in pursuing those goals!  ",

You can easily export your data from your current project management software to a JSON file, and import all of your data to Quire! Quick and pain-free!   We believe you have your own reasons to migrate to Quire from other project management softwares. In case you are new to Quire, here is a quick summary why people switch to Quire:    A simple and clean user interface is the thing that Quire users appreciate the most. It‚Äôs always our top priority to develop Quire. Besides, a intuitive user experience that requires little to no training process is one thing that makes Quire special.  Nested task list is our unique feature that you can break down big ideas into smaller, doable tasks. You can organize them in a hierarchical task list which maps your mind.  Kanban board is an option for you to get focus when your task list is long. You can select a few, crucial tasks which you need to pay attention in a short period of time and move them to a Kanban board and manage them in visual workflows. More important, you can switch back to the nested task list view anytime to get the big picture.    So, how can I import my data?   Okay, here are few simple steps that you can follow to import the JSON file.    Create a new project on Quire  Click on the dropdown menu next to your new project‚Äôs name  Select and import your local JSON file  Voila! All of your data have been successfully imported into Quire system. Now you can start working on your project on Quire!    See? Fast, simple and easy!   Tips:   If you‚Äôre importing data from Asana‚Ä¶       After you finish imported your data, the data will be transferred automatically into the tree structure task list view as a default setting. All of the subtasks in the description section on Asana will be treated as subtasks in the task list on Quire. If you wish to use Kanban Board view, you can add your tasks from your task list view to the board.   If you‚Äôre importing data from Trello‚Ä¶        All of your board and cards from Trello will be automatically transferred to Kanban Board in Quire. The tags, descriptions and comments will also be transferred into the appropriate sections. Also, if you want to work with your project in a nested task list view mode, you can switch to tasks. All of your tasks have been successfully transferred there.   If you‚Äôre importing data from Wunderlist‚Ä¶        All of the lists from the left sidebar in Wunderlist will be treated as root task in Quire, and the tasks inside the lists will be treated as subtasks. If there‚Äôs a subtask in Wunderlist, it will become the sub-subtask in Quire. If you wish to treat each list from Wunderlist as a project in Quire, you can move these tasks to other projects.   So what are you waiting for? Start your journey with Quire now!   And in case you&#39;re still sitting on the fence when it comes to choose the right task management software, we&#39;ve prepared a list for you. Check out here.

        "title": "Say Hello to Your New Year‚Äôs Resolutions in A Productive 2019",
        "excerpt": "   We got days till Christmas. And New Year.   The moment midnight strikes, people will be making their New Year‚Äôs resolutions for 2019. Whether you are starting fresh or picking up projects from where you left off in 2018‚Äîwe got you covered!   For Project Management   Quire ‚Äî A visual collaborative platform for your projects   Brilliant project starts with brilliant ideas. And it all begins in Quire.   You can easily jot down your ideas and organize them in a nested task list, and focus on completing it in a visual Kanban board.          In addition, we have handpicked a couple productivity apps to help your projects too:   For Communications   Slack ‚Äî The one place for your teams to communicate and interact   From brainstorming on ideas, sharing what you have done, to searching for messages from way back last month, Slack is all you need.   It brings all of your team‚Äôs chats, talks, and discussions together in a single place.          For File Management   G Suite ‚Äî A must-have online productivity suite   When it comes to storing, editing and managing your work, G Suite got documents (Google Docs), spreadsheets (Google Sheets), presentations (Google Slides) and more.   Take for example Google Docs. What better way to share your ideas with others, work on them, and edit them together in real-time?          For Time Tracking &amp; Time Management   Toggl ‚Äî A time-tracking app that keeps up with your projects   No idea where your hours are going? Toggl tracks the time spent on your work, creates reports for it, and helps you see how long your tasks or projects last.   With its time tracker, you can press a button to record time, or enter it manually. You can even add tags, member or client‚Äôs name, and other details.          For Workflow with Others   Zapier ‚Äî An integration platform to connect with apps you love   A powerful way to boost productivity is Zapier. It connects over 1,000 applications and ties them together‚Äî including the ones you use everyday.   By creating a ‚ÄúZap‚Äù, you define an action, and set it up to repeat when triggers happen. Let say you receive an email in Gmail from someone (aka a ‚Äútrigger‚Äù), you would automatically receive a SMS notification (aka an ‚Äúaction‚Äù).

        "title": "To Do List and Kanban: What Project Management Did Wrong",
        "excerpt": "   Be it teams, agencies, or companies, there must have been a time when they looked for project management tools or softwares, tried each one of them, and asked all sorts of questions about them, hoping to choose the best project management software to accomplish their next big, amazing projects.   Unfortunately, there is no one-for-all, perfect solution. Just the right one to help you boost your productivity.   What is the Right Project Management Software for You?   We had many users who told us they tried tens or even hundreds of apps they could find out there with no success, not until they met Quire; We also had to say goodbye to one who just cannot get past the digital barrier and eventually returned to good old-fashioned pen and paper.   So what exactly is the right project management software? What is the one approach that works for you?   For us, after years of developing Quire and talking to our users, we believe the right approach is one that bring your dreams to life via planning in ‚ÄúNested to do list‚Äù and doing in ‚ÄúKanban board.‚Äù   The ‚ÄúTo Do List‚Äù Method: A Simple, Yet Flat List Without Structure   A ‚Äúto do list‚Äù is a traditional, straightforward way for you to remember your ideas, notes and to-dos, and do them orderly.   It is just like in the old days, you would use pen and paper to jot down to-dos in a bulleted or numbered list. It is what most users are familiar with, what comes natural to them.   That said, you can easily end up with a long, and flat list of tasks that are equally important, thus making it difficult to show their relationships.          You can easily get lost in a long, flat to do list  The ‚ÄúNested To Do List‚Äù: A Hierarchical List with Context   We took ‚Äúto do list‚Äù to the next level, and we call it the ‚Äúnested to do list‚Äù.   For big, challenging projects, you can break down ideas into chunks, and further into small, bite-sized pieces. What you then get is a well-structured, well-planned    hierarchical actionable list of tasks and subtasks.   For example, you want to make an awesome video game, possibly the next Lineage M.           You can see the big picture in a nested to do list  When each item has been divided into smaller and smaller steps, you have a nicely laid-out plan ready for action.   ‚ÄúNested To Do List‚Äù and ‚ÄúKanban Board‚Äù: The Perfect Duo   Unfortunately, ‚Äúnested to do list‚Äù is not perfect on its own ‚Äî especially for teams collaborating on a challenging project ‚Äî when it comes to ‚Äúexecution‚Äù. Thus we brought ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù on board to complement it.   Dating back to traditional whiteboard with post-its, Kanban is two words in Japanese: Áúã (kan) and Êùø (ban). It can be translated into ‚Äúa board to look at.‚Äù   Kanban board is visual. It makes it easy to manage tasks, and focus on completing them in a smooth workflow. In other words, it makes up the ‚Äúexecution‚Äù stage lacking in ‚ÄúNested to do list.‚Äù   According to Harvard Business Review, such an approach not only shows the progress of each member‚Äôs work, but also if someone is struggling and falling behind.   By combining ‚ÄúNested to do list‚Äù and ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù, two of the most popular approaches to project management today, we help teams bring their ideas to reality.   Take a look at Quire. What it offers is a brand new, revolutionary Agile bridge between ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo do list‚Äù. The best of both worlds.          When ‚Äúnested to do list‚Äù meets ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù in Quire  Wait! Didn‚Äôt Others Already Have To Do List and Kanban?   Yes, a few. But we do it quite differently.   What others do is they treat ‚ÄúTo do list‚Äù and ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù as two separate worlds (projects). Take Asana and GitHub for example.   In our opinion, ‚Äúnested to do list‚Äù is good for planning a project, and ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù is for executing the same project collaboratively. It does not make sense to take a project and divide it into two; Not only is it tedious to manage tasks, but you also lose track of them.   So, What Makes Quire Different?   In Quire, ‚ÄúNested to do list‚Äù and ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù have very different purposes: the former is to organize your project and see its big picture, and the latter is to focus on completing a few crucial tasks at a time from the same project.   It makes perfect sense to stay in the same world, whichever mode you are in.          Other project management softwares (left) vs Quire (right)  For instance, in a weekly product meeting, you can easily switch to ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù to see what features are to implement this week and back to ‚ÄúNested to do list‚Äù to see what major milestones are to achieve this year.   In addition, it makes sense to have multiple Kanban boards for a project, especially when a big team is working on it.   You can add different boards for different teams, such as RD and Marketing, for each team to focus on their tasks in the specified board.   You can even further dive into tasks in your own swimlane in the board!   One World, Two Views Multiplied   Such is Quire‚Äôs interpretation of ‚ÄúNested to do list‚Äù and ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù. It is our philosophy of the best way to boost a team‚Äôs efficiency and help them sail their dreams.   You can focus on the most crucial tasks, standing unaffected and undisturbed by the rest, in ‚ÄúKanban board‚Äù, and see the big picture of your project that these tasks are a part of in ‚ÄúNested To do list‚Äù, without feeling the pressure of completing them all.

        "title": "Quire Mark III: Nested Tasks Meets Board",
        "excerpt": "   Today, we are proud to announce: Quire Mark III for you to streamline your workflow visually in a board.   For years, many Quire users have enjoyed ‚Äúnested tasks‚Äù to see and organize their ideas into a well-planned list of small, actionable to-dos.   Now, with Kanban board, execution on your to-dos is made even easier! You can focus on your daily, prioritized tasks in a visual representation of your workflow, and at any time switch to see the big picture of your actionable plan.   What Can You Do in A Board?   In the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù view of your project, you can add multiple boards, each with different statuses, to better manage your team‚Äôs tasks and focus on completing them.   For example, you and your team want to build a mobile app.    First, you have your ideas broken down into tasks and subtasks in the ‚ÄúTasks‚Äù view.          Next, in the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù view,  you add three boards named Design, Development and Marketing for different teams each week of the month.          Then, you pick out a couple tasks to add them to status columns like To Dos, Development, Testing and Completed.          You can also set filter like sort by Assignee to further focus on tasks in your own swimlane!          Wait! Didn‚Äôt Others Already Have To Do List and Kanban?   Yes, a few do. But we do it quite differently.   For most of them, To Do List and Kanban are two different projects. You have to choose one of them, not both, when working on a project.   For Quire, To Do List (actually ‚ÄúNested‚Äù To Do List) and Kanban are two different working modes of the same project. You break down ideas into a list of to-dos, pick a few out, and add them to boards to manage and complete them in a short period of time.   In short, Quire‚Äôs nested ‚ÄúTasks‚Äù view is good for planning and seeing the big picture of your project, while the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù view is more for visualizing the project‚Äôs tasks for tracking and focusing.          Without You, We Would Not Have Made This Far.   Like always, we want to thank you all for your feedback and support.    Quire 3.0 now offers an Agile bridge between board and nested to do list. When combined together, they give your team an even more natural, smoother workflow from ideas to action.   So have a go! And let us hear your thoughts below.  ",

        "excerpt": "   Quire is designed to help you realize your goals from first capturing your ideas, to turning them into minimal todos for action. Whenever, wherever you want.   Today, we took Quire iOS 2.0 to another level: not only did we added new features, we also enhanced it for better consistency and better UX so you can enjoy the same experience across all devices.   You can see the new features and enhancements highlighted below.   Multi-Select Tasks   You can now select multiple tasks simultaneously to bulk assign tasks.   For example, you can select 15 tasks to give them the same due date at once without going into each task one by one ‚Äî which is insanely tedious.   There are two ways to multi-select tasks: long tap a task, or swipe a task from the right edge of your iPhone/iPad‚Äôs screen.   Then, you can tap on any icon in the menu bar for batch operation.          Customizable Filters   Filtering has never been this flexible and easy with multiple criteria/conditions.   For example, you can filter tasks by priority and multiple tags at the same time.   You can also tap the ‚Äústar‚Äù icon on the right of the filter to save this filtered view for later use.          Dark Theme   We understand how your eyes can feel tired working at night.   To help you work more comfortably, we added a Dark Theme that you can switch to in ‚ÄúMy Profile‚Äù settings.          Performance and Stability   In this milestone of our iOS app, you will enjoy an even faster speed, and an even more stable Quire.   For example, it is now at least 200% faster to open the sidebar and switch to another project.          Breadcrumbs   Not just when you sort and filter! In Quire iOS 2.0, you can see the breadcrumbs ‚Äî aka parent tasks, grandparent tasks, etc. ‚Äî of each task after you filter by Status, including In Progress and Completed, in landscape mode.          Better Consistency, Better UX Experience   We have enhanced our iOS app, matching it to our web app for better consistency, and better UX experience.   For example, notice the assignee, date, tag, priority, etc., icons? They are in the same location as those in the web app to save you time from familiarizing with them.

        "title": "Quire: Building a Sophisticated Mobile App with Google‚Äôs Flutter",
        "excerpt": "   A couple years ago, we developed Quire iOS app in Swift. Last year, we chose Flutter for developing Quire Android app. I‚Äôd like to share my experience of developing the Android app with Flutter - the good and the bad, the strengths and weaknesses - in this article.   Who we are   I‚Äôm a front-end developer of Quire, a simple, lightweight project management tool for capturing ideas, managing tasks and collaborating with teams. For many years, we use Dart on both our server and web so here we are, building our Android app with this new open source mobile development framework Flutter that uses the Dart programming language. Two months have passed since its official launch in the Play Store, I believe it‚Äôs time for us to share the journey with Flutter, offer some feedbacks and thoughts, and hopefully enlighten those of you in the Flutter community or interested in joining it.   Why Flutter   One of the main reasons to use Flutter is that we‚Äôd like to streamline our development using a single language, and the same platform. Quire is an application that evolves quickly; We release a new update almost on a weekly - if not daily - basis. Maintaining two copies of code has become a burden over time. At first, we tried the so-called Hybrid Mobile App approach like Cordova as a solution, but the resulting UI and UX didn‚Äôt reach the standard we‚Äôre aiming at. Flutter, on the other hand, has high performance UI rendering, smooth transition characters and a core language: Dart, of which the model is shared on all server, web and mobile sides. Flutter meets our requirements to develop a high-quality, single-codebase and fast development cycle.   What is Flutter   Flutter is a UI framework for Android and iOS apps by Google. We can just write UI code once, and run it on both platform. It also provides a bridge to native, so you can do almost everything that Swift/Kotlin/Java does. The core concepts for Flutter are drawing and bridging, as described in the following:   Drawing Canvas   Flutter directly draws UI on canvas in the UIViewController of iOS and Activity of Android. Our Dart UI code will be compiled into machine code and drawing. That‚Äôs why Flutter has smooth UI and transition. If we compare it to CSS, they use simpler layout model, which is better than such CSS complexible layout model.   Bridge   If we need to access each platform‚Äôs resource, we can use bridge to transfer our Dart command and data to native level, and vise versa. Since drawing on Canvas is in Flutter environment, there is no need to use bridge to native code, which reduces the cost of context switch, much lower than that of other hybrid frameworks like React Native.   Flutter vs iOS SDK   Flutter is a open source framework, and that means you can quickly understand what‚Äôs going on in every API call. What‚Äôs more, we can trace the whole system‚Äôs architecture and mechanism. If you are using iOS SDK, then you may need to read countless books, from the simplest to the hardest, trial and error for so many times, and thus be able to find the real, underlying rules of logic eventually.   Language Level   If you have couple years of experience in Swift, you may have heard the local reasoning character for Swift. But it doesn‚Äôt mean the SDK level has the same one. For example, when we need to set the delegate for UIView based component, or set the callback for the function call in most cases, the related operation flows are always in different sections due to delegate pattern. The callback pattern also causes the callback hell issue.   You may ask, what‚Äôs the best async pattern in Swift? Callback? GCD? PromiseKit? Or even Reactive Swift? It seems there is no perfect solution for it. With Dart, we only need to do something like this:  Future scrollToComment(Comment comment) async {   await model.scrollTo(comment.position);   await model.highlight(comment); }  That‚Äôs the truth of local reasoning. Right?    Swift gets another point deducted because of build time. Three years ago, we started our model porting and iOS UI implementation using Swift. Our codebase eventually grew and became huge, with the compile time increasing day by day. Nothing is more painful than expecting something to happen in an instant but it takes longer than expected.   We probably can tolerate 2 or 3 minutes of compilation time for release, as this process can be automatic and doesn‚Äôt happen frequently. But what if we just change a line of code for style update and checking the result? In the worst case, we have to wait more than a minute!   You may see there are many articles on improving the time of compilation by changing your syntax, which actually goes against the reason we use a new language for clearer syntax and better productivity. Whereas Dart, it not only has Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler to optimize speed for production release, but also a JIT compiler for fast development. Updating a line of code now only needs 0.5 second in most cases. We are quite happy with the result.   Framework Level   Using Storyboard in Interface Builder (IB) to build UI is like a dream come true. We only need to drag and drop to create widgets and everything will be done. But in the real world, UI is not such an easy task to fulfil, especially when you may have heard someone suggesting you to keep the file Storyboard as small as possible, or simply don‚Äôt use it.   We finally decided to stop using IB when we reached its limitation and performance impact. But building the UI programmatically in iOS is also a nightmare. For  example, UI components, autolayout, legacy layout and transitions need more codes than you expected; Code block will look disorganized; And you always need to read tons of documents to make sure your implementation meets every rule.   Flutter uses ‚ÄúCode as UI template‚Äù in Dart 2.0, composing UI just like a JSX/XML/HTML style. This makes us easy to maintain UI code.  Container(  child: Center(    child: Row(      children: [        Icon(‚Äòsmile‚Äô),        Text(‚ÄòHi‚Äô, style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red))      ]    )  ) )  Layout in iOS‚Äô official solution has never made sense to me. Third party solutions in iOS are always the winner in this bottle. For me, Flexbox is better than AutoLayout-like solution. Its UI composing is much easier and more intuitive. Flutter use Flexbox concept for layout model. In addition, there is a document to guide web developers each step of the way. Being a web front-end developer for many years, that‚Äôs obviously good news.   In our case, the case of Quire, the Bridge from/to native is a the last line of defense. We always keep it in mind that if there is no other solution to do that, we can at least do it like what native iOS/Android developer did. This promises that we can deliver any feature even in the worst case, since we are using a beta version framework (which was actually still in Alpha during our development of the first version to be submitted to the Play Store). For example, we found the time it takes to compress a photo is very long (about 50 seconds, 70% image quality) using Dart. With Java code, it only needs 0.5 second.   Things to look out with Flutter   Flutter is still in Beta and evolving fast. We should bear in mind that things may change without any guarantee. Below, you will find a few features I think are missing and should be considered by Flutter for their next or future release.   No scrollTo index API yet   If you are using the ListView, you can only scroll this view by giving the scroll offset. It‚Äôs easy for fixing row height case, whereas for various row height case, it‚Äôs a little bit complicated to achieve this. Our idea in Quire app is     Give each row a index. Scroll a constant distance to check which of these widget states is generated so to see what the current range is. Search many times for step 2 until our target row appears.   In the case of a super long list, to optimize its smoothness, we introduced the recommended row height variable. Scrolling based on the row height will make sure scrolling can be more accurate, and smoother in a long list.   Model flow and binding with UI initState and dispose   Design for model binding should make sure the model can be listened to many times, and be countable. In our experience, you can bind it in initState, unbind it in dispose, and start/stop the model operation when binding exists and without any listener. Make sure you do not emit any event when binding (e.g. Fire event in initState). Why? Because of the initState/dispose of a state is executing, the event will cause other listeners to receive the event and update the state, while the context scope is locked.   Don‚Äôt cache widget. Build is the core philosophy for Flutter   The building cost is not as expensive as you imagined. If you cache it, you have to handle your cleanup as well. Leave that work to Flutter, it can do this using the React concept, diff and only update the necessary one. In our case, the Quire tree view, we tested more than 2,000 rows in ListView (for some reason, we didn‚Äôt use builder solution of ListView). It‚Äôs much faster than our expected due to Stateful Widget which only generates row states when it‚Äôs in the viewport. For the build cache, Flutter has published an article for it.   Most iOS-look widgets are not ready   Flutter is currently focusing on Material design components. It‚Äôs fine to use them in iOS because material design is commonly designed for cross platform. But in some cases, it‚Äôs not as good as in Android. Take for example the wheel based datepicker. Overall, I think it‚Äôs still necessary to offer a user experience that matches the native behavior in iOS.   Input in Flutter   There are many input related issues. For example, in issue #13765, you should be able to see the newline before you enter more words; In issue #5986, there is no chance to know what key the user entered.   Conclusion   Flutter is a powerful framework for creating both Android and iOS native app. We enjoyed it while developing our Android app, and shall enjoy it even more when it‚Äôs officially released. Even though it was in Alpha and now Beta, Flutter has always been very stable. Its developers are also very active in answering any question or issues you have.   Being an open source framework, it lets you easily track what‚Äôs going on, what‚Äôs been fixed and updated. You can even fix the issues yourself and contribute to the community! Flutter - a high-performing cross-platform framework that comes with native behavior - is definitely the best solution for you. We are currently planning to replace our Swift-based iOS app with Flutter in the coming months, and I shall share our experience again when that time comes. Keep going Flutter, you are absolutely awesome.  ",

        "title": "4 productivity tips that make sense for your project in 2018",
        "excerpt": "   A new year is a new start, and it often comes with a new determination to do better, and be better.   If 2017 ended unhappily for you with chaos like sticky notes being everywhere all the time, figuring out what was where in your head nonstop and chasing after your colleagues for updates tirelessly, it is time for a change.   That change, is GTD method. If you haven‚Äôt heard or read about Getting Things Done, Proposed by David Allen, it is a way for getting organized and stay productive. Chris Winfield‚Äôs system is a simpler vision of it and I call it, the 4 Ds.          1. Dream it. Know the big picture   People say your goals should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timed. In J.D. Roth‚Äôs article, it is about being realistic of your dream with hierarchical, achievable goals to achieve it for a large purpose ultimately. I couldn‚Äôt agree more.   Let‚Äôs say my friends and I have a vision: make the Earth a better place by creating a lightweight, grab-n-go water bottle.   We see how it has become a habit for people to buy Coke from 7-Eleven that come in plastic bottles, or how OLs grab Starbucks coffee in paper cup on their way to work. If we could make a portable water bottle great for all kinds of drinks, we can help reduce plastic waste, and thus contribute to a better Earth - the one and only place we now live in.   Creating it is one thing; Letting people know about it is another story. So how do we promote it?    That, is the question of the day. nt to be, what you want to do and where you want to be for now. Don‚Äôt worry about not knowing how to get there. You can fill in the details later.          2. Dump it. Get all your ideas down   First thing first. You can start by jotting down all your ideas. What better way to do it than in Quire? You can dump all of your ideas the second the lightbulb goes on in your head even via Siri.   Let‚Äôs go back to the question on promoting the water bottle.   Right off the bat, ideas like content marketing, social media marketing, viral marketing, email marketing, SEO, leveraging the community - just to name a few - will pop up in our head.   We might not have the details on how to do them yet, but it is perfectly fine to just have the rough, big picture for now.   The key here is to get our ideas down before they fade away.          3. Divide it. Organize, categorize and prioritize   What happens now? We have a list of ideas too big to chew. So, we need to break them down into pieces that are smaller, and easier to tackle.   It is just how we humans think. Naturally.   For example, when we brainstorm about social media marketing, we will think of connecting to influencers on Twitter and Instagrams and also YouTubers to help us spread the words; Thinking further down this line, we can ask them to share beautiful, real-life photos, and upload crazy, funny videos of them using bottle (remember how the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral?).   Also, when we think of leveraging the community, free giveaway of our bottle at charity events like marathons and concerts sound like a wonderful idea. Just look at how Mous is featured in Oscars gift bag.          4. Do it. Complete each task one by one   Now that our ideas are broken down into items that have become actionable, my friends and I can starting doing them!   First, we can start by compiling a list of influencers and YouTubers we know or after asking around, study them a bit to know what they are into, and ask them politely via an email or Twitter message to get the marketing campaign rolling.   The more we complete the items, the closer we are to accomplishing our goal and thus our dream.   The nice thing about Quire is each item - or I should say task - has an assignee, due date, tag, comments, etc. You can rest assured everyone, and everything is on track and stays on track.   Time is money, and you should spend it wisely. Efficiently.   So what are you waiting for? Get that crazy, innovative ideas out of your head and follow the 4 Ds steps yourself!  ",

        "title": "Introducing: Quire for Android",
        "excerpt": "   Finally, it is here. Kicking off the new year 2018, we are proud to present to you: Quire for Android.          We took time to craft and create this app for Android, so we can get it right. We made sure the layout, navigation, gestures and look-and-feel were simple, and intuitive to Android users. We also had help from a group of dedicated Android beta users who provided valuable feedback along the way! Here are a couple things to get you started:   Dump Your Ideas via Text, Camera and Photos   You can add ideas, notes or tasks as plain words, using the Camera of your smartphone, or selecting an existing image from your Gallery. Simply tap on the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon at the bottom-right of your project, and choose Text, Camera or Photos.          Divide Your Ideas into Tasks and Subtasks via Swipe   Our ideas are often too big to chew at once. By swiping each of them from right to left, you can break it down into smaller chunks and further into tiny pieces until they become small enough to tackle.          Drag and Drop to Organize Your Tasks   Once you have broken down your ideas, you will get a long, and possibly unorganized list of tasks. You can organize them, and put everything in order by pressing each of the tasks, and dragging it to its rightful place.          Collaborate with Your Team. Even Offline.   Need to give more details about a task? Share your works with the team? Get instant feedback from your colleagues?   All of it can be done easily.   You can type notes in task description, assign tasks to those responsible, attach files from Google Drive or embed images directly, discuss and interact with team members in comments, etc. Even if you suddenly lose internet connection, you can continue doing what you are doing. Everything will be synced once the connection is back.          Smooth Navigations in A Single Workspace   Just like our web and iOS apps, the Android app also comes in one single workspace with easy-to-understand UI - sidebar (project list), tree view (task list) and detail view (task detail). For example, to go to sidebar, tap on the upper-left hamburger icon of the app in the tree view.          Get Notified Anytime, Anywhere   It is important to stay on top of updates when you are on the go. No matter where you are, you will get notified of new activities, and be reminded of upcoming or overdue tasks so you do not miss out.          Dark Theme for the Comfort of Your Eyes   Eyes grow weary? You can switch to Dark Theme in your Profile view for an instant relief.            We recommend using Android 5.0 or higher to get the best user experience of Quire‚Äôs Android app.   Like always, any feedback, thought or idea is welcome! Share it in our feedback community, or send us an email at feedback@quire.io.  ",

However, for those of you who want to easily identify your tasks and projects in a long list, you can use Markdown, and CSS styles to make them stand out. Additionally, if you want to add special characters, HTML entities are supported too.   Here are a couple examples to get you started:   Add Color &amp; Styles to Task Names   If you type a task name like this:  {color:green|a green task}  You will see:          Or, if you type:  **{color:green, font-size:20px, text-decoration:underline|a big green task}**  It will turn into:          This is what a task list with styles looks like:          Tip: You can quickly add some of the basic styles by typing { and selecting the style you want.

We all know that sometimes, clients have their own habits and it is hard to ask them to change. Now, in addition to asking them to sign up Quire, you can get them to view your Quire project with one single invitation link, and zero effort on their part!   Your clients are just one click away!   All you need to do is send your clients a link. Once they click the link, they will be able to view your project. No need to register an account, or sign in anything! And you get to keep them away from doing the rest to your project.   It takes only a few secs to invite your clients.   First, click on the &quot;arrow&quot; icon beside your project name, and select &quot;Edit members.&quot;          Next, scroll down to Shared Links and click the ‚Äú+ Create new link‚Äù button.          That will generate a share link for you to copy, and send to your clients. They will have till the expiry date to access your project.          Note: Anyone with the link will be able to view your project.   In Shared Links, you can see how many people have accessed the shared link, and edit it to extend the time of access.          Quire not only has your team members in mind, but your clients too.   With shared links, you can easily let your clients see what is going on in your projects, manage who can do so for how long, while counting on them to never do anything they should not.   Got questions?   I have listed a couple FAQs below and if you have more, post them in the comments.   How many share links can I create?   You can create as many share links as you need, and send them to different clients.   Why do I need to create more than one share link?   You may have different clients who need to access your project for different periods of time.   Creating more than one share link lets you manage who can access your project and for how long.   Who can create share links of a project?   Only Admin members of the project can create share links.   What is the difference between sharing a link of a project and making a project public?   When you create a share link of your project and send it to your clients, they can view this project for a period of time.   But when you make a project public, it is open to anyone, not just limited to your clients, as long as it stays public. If there are Quire users, then not only can they view your project, but also add tasks, post comments, etc.  ",

        "excerpt": "   Jos√© Lu√≠s Prado and his family see it as their mission to bring their well-established melons Mel√£o REI from their hometown in Cear√°, northern Brazil, to countries all over the globe.   Founded in 1983 by his father Carlos, Jos√© is the 2nd generation of this family-owned business ITAUEIRA. They grow all kinds of melons from yellow honeydew melons to green melons, watermelons as well as grapes, and ship them to countries including the United States, Chile, Dubai, Russia, Holland, Spain and Italy.   Commercializing their best melons from domestically to internationally is not easy.   Not only are the family and their 1,400 employees responsible for harvesting 4 farms, they also need to take care of operations, finance, legal, sales &amp; marketing, etc.   For all of these that they need to do, they found a solution.    ‚ÄúIt is much easier to assign people, track progress and review what we have done in Quire than doing all these in a spreadsheet.‚Äù -- Jos√© Lu√≠s Prado 2nd generation of melon-growing company ITAUEIRA    Before ITAUEIRA turned down spreadsheet, they have used Quire for about a month. And now, it has been 6 months since they got the app to help them achieve their goal.   ‚ÄúWhat we love most about Quire is its powerful tree-like interface which is intuitive, simple and elegant,‚Äù said Jos√©.   For example, anyone can collapse, expand or filter the tree list of tasks at will in Quire. An employee can filter by priority to focus on a few critical tasks; A manager can filter by assignee to see who did what at what time; The CEO can review the performance of everyone and everything. No more chasing after the team, or figuring out where it is at!   ‚ÄúIt is just much easier to do all these in Quire, much easier to track, and much easier to review what we have done,‚Äù Jos√© concluded. ‚ÄúWith such, we can focus on what we have always wanted to do: take on the world with our best-grown melons.‚Äù   Brazil. Melons. And Quire.   We all know that fruit farming is a traditional business. But this Brazilian family-owned company ITAUEIRA embraced technology to skyrocket their goal. Now, Jos√© and his family and colleagues are able to produce better quality melons, and distribute them to the rest of the world more efficiently. How wonderful!  ",

        "title": "Quire and Slack work great together.",
        "excerpt": "   It is our mission to help you work seamlessly via Quire and other apps you are already comfortably using. With the integration with Slack, we are one step closer.   For those of you who often communicate on Slack, you and your team can now receive updates about your Quire projects right inside a Slack channel, add tasks, comment on tasks and more.   How do I integrate with Slack?   You need to link an organization to a Slack team, and a project to a Slack channel.    Go to Quire &amp; Beyond     Choose Slack and click on Install     Choose the organization that you would like to integrate Slack to     Authorize Quire on your Slack account     Unlink a Slack channel on Quire Organization Settings       Note: A Slack channel can only be linked to one Quire project.   What can I do in a Slack channel?   When you are all set up, here are some commands to get you started in Slack:   1. Get Notified Instantly in Your Slack Channel   You can make a Slack channel follow a project or more for the team to stay on top of changes made in the projects.   Take projects Design Project (with project ID Design_Project) and Marketing Project (with project ID Marketing_Project) for example.   You can type:   /quire follow project Design_Project Marketing_Product   Note: Once you make a channel follow a project or more, everyone will get notified of all activities in the projects.   You can also make the team follow a specific task or more in a project, once you linked it to a Slack channel (see Step 4 above).   For tasks Logo Design (with task ID 123) and UI Design (with task ID 456), you just type:   /quire follow 123 456   2. Add Tasks Directly to Your Quire Project   You can add tasks to a Quire project directly from your Slack channel, and assign it to a team member, set due date, add tags, etc., at the same time.   For example, you can type:   /quire add Logo design @eric &lt;Oct 25; Nov 21&gt; #Design !1   to add a task called Logo design that is assigned to Eric, and has a start date of Oct 25, due date of Nov 21, tag of Design and priority Urgent.   Note: Even when a task is created by you, you need to make the channel follow the task in order to get notified in Slack.   3. Comment on Tasks While You Chat   You can add a comment to a task after a discussion or chat with your team members, right from Slack.   For example, you want to comment on the logo that Eric designed (with task ID 123).   You can type:   /quire comment 123 Looks awesome! Let‚Äôs go with Option 2.   That is not all!   There are a lot more you can do from within a Slack channel. Check out the complete list of commands below.     /quire Command List   Add a task /quire add [task name] For example: /quire add Design new logo   Link a channel to a project /quire link /quire link [project ID or project URL] Example: /quire link Development_Project Example: /quire link https://quire.io/w/development_project   Unlink a channel from project /quire unlink   List all projects and their IDs /quire list project   Search projects /quire list project [keyword 1] [keyword 2] Example: /quire list project Development Marketing   List recent tasks and their IDs /quire list   Search tasks /quire list [keyword 1] [keyword 2] Example: /quire list design logo   View specific tasks /quire list [task ID 1] [task ID 2] Example: /quire list 123 456   List members of the linked Quire project /quire list member   List tags /quire list tag   Add a task under a task /quire add under [parent ID] name Example: /quire add under 12 Design new logo   Add a task beside a task /quire add after [another task ID] name Example: /quire add after 34 Design new logo   Edit a task name /quire edit [task ID] name. Example: /quire edit 123 Design new logo   Assign members, date, priority and tags to a task /quire assign [task ID] [@team member name] [!priority] [#tag] [&lt;due&gt;] Example: /quire assign 123 @eric @jess #design !1  Example: /quire assign 123 +@david -@jess +#marketing   Comment a task /quire comment [task ID] comment Example: /quire comment 123 This looks awesome!

        "excerpt": "   Not long ago, I talked to Michael, a copywriter whose son goes to a primary school in Austria, about how 100 parents, students and teachers built and run their school together.   This time, Quire made its way into a university in the United States.   Victor Law, a 5th year student majoring in Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, spoke to me about how Quire has helped him and his team prepare for the annual off-road vehicles race.    ‚ÄúQuire helps us stay on track, and more importantly, makes sure we are delivering the best-quality designs.‚Äù -- Victor Law Engineering Student at Georgia Institute of Technology           Tell me a little bit about you and your team.   I am the team lead of GT Off-Road, a student led organization that designs, and builds a single seat Baja racing vehicle to compete in the annual Baja SAE competition.   Every year, about 100 collegiate teams from all over the world will come and compete in three different competitions held in different locations. Teams will be judged on their designs, their vehicle cost, and their vehicle performance.   This semester, we are finishing designs for the 2018 competition vehicle, which will first compete in the 2018 Baja SAE Maryland competition, and training new recruits on fabrication techniques.          How did you come by Quire?   In the beginning, we would talk about what needs to be done verbally and get updates of progress through weekly meetings. This was rather inefficient. Sometimes, progress even got lost!   Then, we started learning how to use Trello. But it lacked organizational structure.   Quire was introduced to us by a team member around that time. When the member saw what we were trying to do, he brought up that he had used a solution called Quire in another work setting.          How has Quire helped you since?   With 40 members involved, our team is broken down into various subsystems including suspension, chassis, drivetrain, data acquisition and manufacturing, each responsible for sections of the car.   Quire lets us keep track of our progress visually at any time, and save time in our weekly meetings going over subsystem updates. We can quickly, and easily see who is responsible for what, what are making projects slipping from their deadlines, etc.   Here is an example of how we use Quire: when a subsystem lead assigns a task to a member and whenever the member completes the task, he or she will comment on the task saying finished. Then, the subsystem lead will review the task and mark it as complete if the quality was there. If not, the task will stay in progress until it passes review.    Therefore, not only has Quire helped us to be more organized, but it also helped us ensure high quality designs.         ",

        "excerpt": "   Tasks, projects, organizations and smart folders make up the hierarchical structure of Quire.   In this blog post, we will clarify what each of them is, and illustrate a few examples on how you can use them at will.   Task           Note: Tasks in the middle main panel of your Quire workspace.    A task is an actionable item to be done. It can be broken down into subtasks, sub-subtasks, and so on.   But it can also be ideas, notes or sections that you want to jot down first and divide into smaller items later.   Getting Started with Quire is one example of documentation.   Project           Note: Project in the middle main panel of your Quire workspace.            Note: Projects in the left sidebar of your Quire workspace.    A project is made up of tasks. It is a goal, or a challenge that you and your colleagues, family or friends want to accomplish together.   For example, it can be a marketing campaign you and your team want to run, a cool app you and your designer want to make, a trip to Europe you and your friends want to plan, etc.   Organization           Note: Organizations in the left sidebar of your Quire workspace.    An organization consists of projects. It is a company, department or team that works on projects in it.    But organization can also be a group of projects, or simply a part of your life called Work, Home, Volunteer, etc.   Let‚Äôs say you have an organization called Family; You can then add projects that you and your family want to achieve together in it.   Smart Folder           Note: Smart Folder in the middle main panel of your Quire workspace.            Note: Smart Folders in the left sidebar of your Quire workspace.    Smart folder is a virtual folder of projects from different organizations.   Having the full power of a project, you can get a bird‚Äôs view of everything happening in the projects you care about, and narrow them down to focus on just a few tasks via filter.   You can also add different smart folders called eg., Development and Marketing to manage different groups of people working on different projects.   They Keep You Well-Organized   Now, you should have an understanding of what a task, project, organization and smart folder are, and how they can be used.   They are a lot more flexible than what their names suggest. Let‚Äôs start adding them and organizing your people and work; In your own terms!  ",

        "excerpt": "   Today is the day Quire goes big. The day we present Quire Mark II to you, the best-ever-made collaborative task management app to bring your ideas to life.   ‚ÄúGenius is in the idea. Impact, however, comes from action,‚Äù said Simon Sinek. Many people have a dream, and they talk about it with every bit of exciting details. What makes it even more exciting is to realize it, to really make a difference. Imagine you adding your own color to the painting called the world!   This is exactly where Quire - Quire Mark II to be more precise - comes in. To help you evolutionize your life, revolutionize the world.   What is new? Just about everything, and more!   Capturing your ideas, and breaking them down for achievement are what we do best. Now, Quire Mark II sets a new standard for accomplishing them with ease, and a little grace. And it opens up possibilities for anchoring your dreams in reality.   Smart Folders: View all related projects at once   To start off, we have smart folder, a folder of different projects from different organizations where you can review, reorganize your ideas and tasks in them.          Profile View: Understand the performance of each project and member   Profile view lets you see in a glance how healthy your projects, organizations and team members are with for instance the % of your completed tasks, and the # of tasks your members are responsible for this week.          Blink Search: Find exactly what you have in mind in an instant   In addition to full-text search, we also got Blink Search for you to fast find whatever you have in mind, and easily switch between all your projects, organizations and members. Press Ctrl+B or Cmd+B (for Mac), type a few characters and get exactly what you want!          Dark Theme: Feel comfortable even when it is late at night   Bored with the light theme? You can now switch to Monochrome Dark for an amazing contrast in your workspace, and to let your eyeballs rest.          That is not all!   There are so much to enjoy in the all-new Quire. Here are a few little touches we think you are going to love:   Floating Detail Panel: Keep your workspace clean without any noise   To keep your workspace clean without any clutter, we made the detail panel flippable. And it is easy to flip it open with SPACE if needed.          Members in Sidebar: Easily check the status of every one of your members   We got all your members listed in the sidebar, so you can easily click on them to check their status.          Precise Context Menu: Pinpoint what you need quickly, wherever you need it   When you right-click on the item that needs your attention , we simplified the context menu for you to quickly pinpoint what you need.   For example, when you right-click on tags:          For example, when you right-click on complete icon:          We do not stop here. What is next?   It is wonderful how the existing task tree view helps you see the big picture of your ideas in a nested, hierarchical list. But there is more than one angle to see your project.   We will start with calendar view, where you can see in a timely manner what needs to be done on what day, week and month.   Next, to better focus on your tasks at hand, we will roll out kanban view, so you can easily finish one or two tasks at a time in a visualized, prioritized flow of your work.   What is even more amazing? Intelligent Spotlight, essentially AI that we are currently exploring and aiming to suggest you the most likely important tasks for the day.   These are what we are doing for the next phase of Quire Mark II at the moment. It is going to be better than great!   We were not alone. You made it all possible!   Thanks to your many feedbacks, we made a great leap in Quire Mark II. To name a few, Rafael, Steve, Roman, Philipp, Joshua, Tristan, Andr√©s and Lee.

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Building a dream school together in Austria",
        "excerpt": "   I am a Community Manager. As a Community Manager, I talk to our users a lot. They tell me all sorts of stories, from what they enjoy the most about our product, to how they recently traveled to Greece for a 10-day vacation.   But there is one that really caught my eyes.   It is a story about a group of people who were passionate, and brave enough to build their dream ‚Äì yes, literally build it from scratch ‚Äì all by themselves.          A school for children aged 6 to 14 at the foot of the Alps in Austria.   Situated at the foot of the Alps, and in a quiet and beautiful place in Pettenbach, Austria, there is this tiny school right next to a forest. Schule an der Alm (School at the Alm).   In the school, students choose what they want to learn, when they want to learn.   Many classes take place outdoor, as these 6 to 14 years old children concentrate on the subject of their interests in small groups, climb the trees in a race to the top, experience living in a teepee, go skiing, ice skating and sledging during winter, etc.   They have a lot of special activities, too. One that children are particularly excited about is creative day.   On creative day, they have the opportunity and the freedom to go wild with their imagination, like working with wood to craft their own mini houses to using the sewing machine to design their own clothes.          What makes the school even more unique is that, it is built by parents, teachers and children together!   It began with two young women. And a bunch of parents.   It all started about 10 years ago.   Two young women, together with parents like themselves, had a dream to build a school for their children so they could be educated at their will.   Gudrun, one of the teachers at the school then, worked in a normal primary school before.   When it was time for her second son to go to school, ‚ÄúMy son should not be educated the same old way I did,‚Äù she told herself. ‚ÄúHe should not sit in front of a desk for more than 5 hours a day when half of the time is just his teacher talking.‚Äù   So, with such a belief, and joined by the parents she met at Kindergruppe (children‚Äôs group) who share the same belief, they took action ‚Äì founded their own school.   Michael, a gentle, loving father of two from the Kindergruppe, was Gudrun‚Äôs neighbor at the time, and so they decided to start the school at MIchael‚Äôs home.   A school that his 13-year-old son later enrolled as well.   ‚ÄúI already know Gudrun and how she teaches, so did my son. We just like the people and how they worked,‚Äù Michael told me during my interview. ‚ÄúAnd I believe, real good learning has to come from following one‚Äôs own interests, something the school believes in too.‚Äù   It was bold and brave of Gudrun, Michael and other parents to be different, to fearlessly hop on a journey to help children educate in nature, out of their own nature.   And it is a one-of-a-kind dream they did not easily give up, or compromise.    ‚ÄúChildren should have the right to choose what, and when they want to learn, at their own speed.‚Äù -- Michael Praschma a 62-year-old copywriter and one of the parents    It was not until too many children enrolled that teachers, parents and students started adapting their new school building, building classrooms and school backyard.   The adults were responsible for countless duties like cutting the wood, painting the walls and roughing in electrical wiring, while children were helping them to carry objects from one location to another.          Loaded with tasks? They have ‚Äútechnology‚Äù to help with that.   School at the Alm is like a big family, and every single person in the school needs to be involved; Every parent needs to spend at least 100 hours helping out with different tasks every year. And it becomes more each year!   If both parents have a job, or if their children have to be looked for, discussion on which tasks are absolutely necessary or not is a must.   In the early days, they tried to do this via emails, a service everyone is used to. However, it later became difficult for them to tell who was responsible for what, how much something has been done, or what decisions have been made.   ‚ÄúHonestly, emails just resulted in tsunami. So, we spent about 20 hours looking for a solution.‚Äù said Michael, who is responsible for keeping everyone on track.   For me, it was quite surprising how such a ‚Äúhand-made‚Äù school actively looked for and embraced ‚Äútech‚Äù apps to help them move things along smoothly.          The solution they found recently is Quire, Doodle and appear.in.   Quire is a central place for task management, where they add events as tasks to further break down into smaller tasks to collaborate and keep track, whereas Doodle is used to decide a meeting time and appear.in for arranging a video call in meetings.   ‚ÄúDoodle and appear.in, they very much enhance the Quire tool to help us get things rolling,‚Äù said Michael.   10 years have passed, their journey continues...   School at the Alm has now grown into a primary and secondary school with 32 students, 58 parents and 6 teachers for children ages 6 to 14.   Before they welcome the new school year which begins in September, the school will be busy. Super busy.   An open house day will kick off in May. Everybody will be involved, when every parent, teacher and of course student is responsible for different tasks such as making sandwiches for the buffet, preparing presentations for the information stand, and attending little children‚Äôs corner to play with and supervise kids.          Such is the story about School at the Alm.    Did it inspire you to make a difference in the world? Did it awaken the giant in your heart? Do you now have a journey you want to pursue? Just go for it!  ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Delivering what our clients want when they want.",
        "excerpt": "   We all know how hideous it can be for one to take many roles, be responsible for a team, and manage many projects at a time.   Take Nisarg Desai for example.   He is a software engineer, a team leader and also a project coordinator in a startup company called Troot Technologies LLP in India. His team, consisting of a total of 10 people, is divided into two teams and is currently responsible for two projects ‚Äì‚Äì Ecommerce and Android App.   What do they do? Lead a project to its end by finishing the decided functions in decided period of time decided by the client.   And what is their goal? Do it as smoothly as they can.   I had a chance to talk to Nisarg about how Quire made it all possible.   In the beginning, he lost track of his people and projects ‚Äì‚Äì even himself.   Nisarg‚Äôs job requires him to fulfill his duties, and at the same time manage multiple teams and multiple projects. This was not easy.   So, he did a search on Bing and came by a blog post which listed and reviewed project management tools. Quire is one of them.   Before using Quire, his team was using Atlassian and Bug Genie. He could add tasks with specific date and time, and assign to specific team member.   But, there were problems.   For example, he could not identify the status of tasks, the priority of tasks, the type of tasks, etc., the way he wanted. Even though he could add status including Done, Failed, In Process, he needed more like On Hold, Stuck, and Deferred.   And when they requested their client what features they wanted, added them, but then the client changed their minds, they were unable to reflect the change in their project easily.   Of course, there are other tools but they can be very limited and complex, and less flexible, for Nisarg.   In the end, they switched to Quire.   Quire has helped him keep track of everything in the past 10 months.   Nisarg has been using Quire for some time now.   With the ability to instantly add and edit tags, all his problems have been solved. Be it tagging a task regarding its type, progress, or priority, they can see everything in a glance, and keep track of them easily.   Back when they were using Bug Genie for their eCommerce project, they could not do the same.   But with Quire, he can tag a list of tasks with ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù, ‚Äútesting‚Äù, ‚Äúdebugging‚Äù, ‚Äúdesigning‚Äù, ‚Äúdocumenting‚Äù, etc.   Recently, he added the tag ‚Äúsearch on net‚Äù to tasks related to icons and UI widgets, as well as ‚Äúdiscuss the execution plan‚Äù to tasks that they need to discuss, so they can track their project pain-free.    ‚ÄúI am thankful that Quire was created! Now I can keep track of things and do my job at the same time.‚Äù -- Nisarg Desai Project Coordinator of Troot Technologies LLP   ",

        "title": "Dream Chasers: Doing more, while staying small in team.",
        "excerpt": "   For many of us, the biggest challenge is to stay productive and organized as our team grows bigger and bigger. But it is the opposite for Ray.   Ray works as a senior software engineer in Aerovironment, Inc., a technology company located in California, United States. For him, the question is how to get more things done in a team that shrinked from 12 to 4-5 people.    ‚ÄúI found myself having to do many things simultaneously. But Quire has helped me prioritize with my work so I do not feel stressed.‚Äù -- Ray Senior Software Engineer of Aerovironment, Inc.    I spoke to Ray about how Quire has helped him stay away from chaos and pressure. Here is the interview in a nutshell.   How did you find out about Quire?   Years ago, I used to use a PIM software called ECCO Pro. The thing I liked about it was that it allowed you to set up hierarchical to-do lists which is exactly how I think about my work. It seemed no other software did that at the time.   Unfortunately, the company went out of business. So I did a search to find a ‚Äúhierarchical todo list‚Äù software, and Quire was what I found.   Was there any problem or challenge before you started using Quire?   Yes, there definitely was.   As our team got smaller, I found myself having to manage many projects at the same time, and trying to remember where I was in each one.   It was very difficult to stay organized, when your to-do list kept growing.   Mind telling us how has Quire helped you then?   I have been using Quire now for about 2 months now. It has helped me a great deal.   For example, it has helped me to prioritize my work and remember where I am in projects that I have to move away from and come back to. It has also helped me discipline myself to write things down, so I don‚Äôt feel stressed trying to keep everything in my head.   I use the tree structure to indicate dependencies - subtasks must be completed before their parent task is done.   Lastly, anything you would like to say to the Quire team?   Recently, I have begun adding tasks for my team members, inviting them to join Quire and asking them to check off tasks after completing them.   I believe eventually, Quire might just become the perfect team coordination tool - what it is especially designed to be - for us.  ",

        "excerpt": "   With 30 sales people, 40 fund managers and thousands of clients across the globe, Quire‚Äôs simplicity and flexibility allow Green Shoots Capital to keep everyone and everything in one central place.   Collaborating with different people from different countries can be tedious - but not for us at Green Shoots Capital.   We are a Switzerland-based financial company that sells financial products. Three months ago, we found ourselves spending hours each day to figure out who is doing what and what has been updated.   Given that we have about 30 team members (all under 50 by the way) from countries including Switzerland, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Dubai working with 40 fund managers and thousands of clients, the company needed a tool to bring all our team, communication and data into one central place.    ‚ÄúWe are a multi-dimensional team. Everything has to fit in a simple system that lets us collaborate easily despite distance. Quire is perfect.‚Äù -- Sebastian Schaefer Founder of Green Shoots Capital    The biggest challenge my team and I had before using Quire was being able to easily refer to our clients‚Äô data and keep track of everything that is going on. ‚ÄúWe did not want to use a CRM system that comes with too much things and too much complexity,‚Äù said Sebastian, founder of Green Shoots Capital. ‚ÄúIt simply will not help our team to do what we are supposed to do.‚Äù   Now in Quire, we have every colleague as a project and in each project, each client that the colleague is responsible for as a task that includes the client‚Äôs profile in its description. If we ever need to focus on a specific group of clients, we just add tags (eg. 10 different tag for 10 different products) and filter by them.   For example, my colleague is working with a client - a top Swiss bank - and she had a meeting to show them a fund product. When I wanted to know how it went and give some suggestions, I simply posted a comment which was nicely time stamped, and so right after being notified of it, she could check it out.   For us, Quire keeps communication between different people from different countries easy, and everything else organized and ready within our reach, in ways it never was before!    ‚ÄúQuire has done a great job for us. It really works for us and is updating everything super quickly and whenever I want to check something, it is there.‚Äù -- Sebastian Schaefer Founder of Green Shoots Capital   ",

As such a joyous time approaches, we want to take this opportunity to thank all of you, and share some thoughts and facts before we call it a year.   Looking Back‚Ä¶   We listened to your voice.   We would not be here without you - awesome people who have taken the ride with us in 2016. You are making Quire as good as it can be.   Thank you Tristan for being with us from the beginning; Thank you Mauro for your insanely quick likes and retweets; Thank you Roberto for all the ideas and feedback you shared; Thank you Dimitrios for sharing that beautiful photo of your fireplace.   The list can go on but these are a few.   You are what kept our spirit alive.   Throughout the year, we have users from the United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Brazil, France, Australia, Uganda, Egypt, Ethiopia and 158 other countries who are excited about Quire.   We want to say thank you, thank you all for choosing, sharing, and inviting your teams to join Quire. We cannot express our gratitude enough.   Quire has been acknowledged by you as a simple and intuitive app for ideas as it helps you go all the way from planning, organizing to completing whatever goals or dreams you have with your colleagues or friends.    ‚ÄúQuire is a breath of fresh air.‚Äù -- Paul Bohm   ‚ÄúSimple, clean to organize tasks in a complex project.‚Äù -- Stuart Mentzer    We see it as our mission to get to know you. We talked to you with every chance we had, and responded to your feedback quicker than expected.   And it was from these that gave life to the features you are enjoying right now.   Yes, we made amazing features.   We are proud to say that Quire has been rocking hard. Just this year alone, we have accomplished so much.   Not to mention the Chrome Extension which lets you access Quire from any webpage and the beautifully designed iOS app for your iPhone and iPad (and yes, an Android one will be available too).   Here are what we have done, at least the bigger ones, in case you missed them:    Multiple assignees Multiple drag &amp; drop Start and due time Reminders Task status Copy and paste from other apps into Quire Auto-add with @, #, &lt;&gt; and ! Right-click on task for context menu Favorites Emoji   To stay in the loop of our latest news and updates, follow us on Twitter!   Looking Ahead‚Ä¶   We cannot wait till 2017 to come. Why? Because it will be an exciting year when we welcome the birth of Quire 2.0 - the best Quire ever made.   It is no surprise that tree list (aka outline) is everyone‚Äôs most beloved feature of all. Considering that breaking things down into small pieces is what people naturally do when they face a big challenge.   That said, you can easily end up with a growing long list of to-dos and they become difficult to manage and complete.   This is why in Quire Mark II (aka Quire 2.0), Quire will come with the whole package from easily capturing all your brilliant ideas, to turning them into a well-organized plan and completing its step-by-step actions in a timely manner.   To be a little more specific, you will be looking at outline plus kanban boards all wrapped in an even simpler and friendlier UI.   What You Can Do Now‚Ä¶   It is December. You probably still have ideas dangling in your head.   Now is a good time to dump them out! Simply take about 30 minutes to jot them down and divide them into small pieces, before they disappear at the back of your head.   So, with a fresh new start in 2017, you can get a kick start in that brilliant plan of yours. In the best-ever-made Quire 2.0!   That is a wrap up of our year in 2016.   Without either of our incredible team and users, Quire would not be what it is today. So, thank you for loving it and staying with us.   Let‚Äôs dream big, and be different in 2017. Together!    ‚ÄúThe biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.‚Äù -- Oprah Winfrey   ",

        "title": "It is all about time in task management.",
        "excerpt": "   Time is a tricky thing. We all want to get the most out of it by making the right kind of plan, and doing the right kind of tasks in the right amount of time. But, we often fail.   To solve this problem, Quire has got a series of features including start date and time, due date and time, reminders, status, etc. to help you and your team schedule your tasks, and complete them in a timely manner.   Here is an example of how these features are used:   1. DUE DATE. AND DUE TIME.   It is about 2 months before Christmas. Kevin, a chief editor at a daily newspaper, decided to do a piece on how this special day is celebrated in prisons.   He assigned this task to Megan and gave her a deadline of Dec. 20th, 3pm, leaving enough time for the journalist to finish it, and also himself to review it.          2. START DATE. AND START TIME.   Looking at the tasks at hand, Megan thought Nov. 21st, 4pm, would be a good time to start working on the feature story.          3. REMINDERS.   To not miss the start or due date, she has set reminders to 2 days earlier, in case she forgets about it in the midst of chaos and ends up with only 3 hours left to do it.          4. NOTIFICATIONS.   Then, it was Nov. 19th. Megan got notified in both her Quire workspace and inbox, reminding her to start working on the Christmas feature story.          5. TASK STATUS.   With pen and paper ready at hand, Megan set out for an interview with the inmates behind bars. On the way, she changed the status of the task to In Progress on her iPhone.          Not only did Kevin get notified of the progress, colleagues like the graphic designer and typesetter were notified too, thus keeping everyone on the team in the loop.   6. RECURRING.   Every Tuesday, Megan and chief editor Kevin need to attend a team meeting. Instead of adding a task for each week, she simply added one and set it as repeat.          7. CALENDAR.   Back at the office, Megan has imported all the tasks assigned to her into her calendar, so she can see what her schedule is like for the coming week and month.   For tasks with start date and time, and due date and time, a Gantt chart view is also available in the calendar.          Tip: You can sync your tasks to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar (iCal), Outlook Calendar or other.   The bottom line is, we all care about time.   Often, it is not enough to know what dates tasks should be done, but what time they should be done. And it is with time that reminders can play their part to the fullest, with reminders that notifications can do the same, and so forth.   We hope this whole series of features will help you get the most out of time, without getting run over by it.  ",

        "title": "How to migrate to Quire? Copy and paste.",
        "excerpt": "   Many of you have asked about a way to import your work from a different app into Quire, without going through the trouble of entering them one by one.   Now, we have the answer: Copy and paste.   Be it an Excel sheet with data, a Word document of bullet list, or an email from your coworker, you can easily move them to Quire and continue where you left off, such as breaking down ideas into step-by-step tasks to easily keep track of them and collaborate with your team.   Here are a few examples:   1. Text Editor   You may have a bullet list or notes in text editors such as Notepad and Word.   First, you press Ctrl + C (Cmd + C for Mac) or right click to copy the content.          Next, you go to your Quire project, click on a task and right click to select Paste.          Tip: You can skip this step by simply pressing Ctrl + V (or Cmd + V for Mac) to paste what you copied in a Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge browser.   Then, you press Ctrl + V (Cmd + V for Mac) or right click to paste what you copied for preview.          By default, we recognize the list as multiple tasks, with each line being the name of each task and subtask.   We also automatically translate texts like &lt;tomorrow&gt;, #Marketing, @Megan and !2 into due date, tag, assignee and priority, and omit unnecessary numbers, characters and punctuation marks like ‚Äú-‚Äù and ‚Äú*‚Äù which are supported by Markdown.   If you manually select single task, we will recognize the list you pasted as a single task, with the first line as its name and the rest as its description.   Note: The @assignee and #tag you typed must already be your project members and tags to be added.   2. Gmail   If you want to turn an important email into a task, here is what you do.   You copy the subject and its content.          Then, you go to Quire to paste it.          By default, we recognize what you pasted as a single task, with the subject as its name and the content as its description.   We also automatically omit the unnecessary detail like ‚Äúto me‚Äù and ‚Äú5:25 PM (23 hours ago).‚Äù   If you manually select multiple tasks, we then recognize the content you pasted as multiple tasks, with each line being the name of each task.   For other email service providers including Hotmail and Outlook, we will recognize what you pasted as multiple tasks, with each line being the name of each task.   3. Spreadsheet   First, you copy the header and content in an Excel, Google Sheets or other spreadsheet applications.          Then, you go to Quire to paste what you copied for preview.          By default, we recognize what you pasted as multiple tasks, with each row being the name, attributes and description of each task.   Only columns called Name, Assignee, Tag, Start, Due, Priority, Status, Description, Parent and ID, in no particular order, and the cells below them are recognized. The rest is omitted.   Note: The header column names must be exactly the same with the first letter capitalized.   You can create a tree structure with tasks and subtasks by adding a column called Parent.   For the column Parent to be recognized, you need to have another column called ID.          Under the column ID, you first assign an ID to the parent task.          Then, you go to the task you want to make as the subtask, and enter the parent task ID you have just assigned under the Parent column.          Ta-da! Now you have a tree structure with tasks and subtasks.          If you manually select single task, we will recognize the data you pasted as a single task, with the first line as its name and the rest as its description.   Also, keep in mind that if a task has more than one assignee or tag, you need to have a column for each assignee or tag. Each column will have the same header name ‚Äî Assignee or Tag.   Note: What you typed under columns Assignee and Tag must already be your project members and tags to be added.   When you paste from Excel, there are two limitations to keep in mind:   Date Format.   For columns Start and Due to be recognized, you need to enter dates in the format of the country you selected in your Account Settings. For example, if you selected English (United States), the date format should be Nov 18, 2016. In this example, 11/18/2016, 11-18-2016 and 11.18.2016 are recognized too.   Priority.   For column Priority to be recognized, you need to enter Low, Medium, High or Urgent (not case sensitive).   4. CSV   With a CSV file, it is the same as copying and pasting from a spreadsheet file.   Once again, only those called Name, Assignee, Tag, Start, Due, Priority, Status, Description, Parent and ID and what is below them are recognized.   And keep in mind that if a task has more than one assignee or tag, you need to have a column for each assignee or tag. Each column will have the same header name ‚Äî Assignee or Tag.   Note: What you typed under columns Assignee and Tag must already be your project members and tags to be added.   In short, we have made migration quick and easy. With copy and paste.   You can now bring your work into Quire, from apps or services that you are probably using everyday, including Excel, Word and Gmail, and get it rolling with your team in just seconds!  ",

        "title": "We‚Äôre not Facebook. So why Like?",
        "excerpt": "   What does Quire and Facebook have in common? Likes.   In Quire, we call them favorites. Of course you can ‚ô• a task and feel proud of the 23 number of ‚ô• you get, but more importantly, it‚Äôs a way to easily see the tasks that matter to you. Personally.   In other words, when you want to focus on a few tasks that are important to you and you alone, you ‚ô• them.   Below, we dig into favorites a bit more:   They are personal.   You may ask, why have favorites when we‚Äôve already got priority or tags? The answer is because they‚Äôre personal.   If a task has priority or tags, it‚Äôs shared by every member in the project. That is, your team members can see them, edit them, remove them, etc. But, with favorites, you and yourself alone have the rights to them! Simply put, they‚Äôre like your personal bookmarks.   For example, you have a task or two that that you want to focus on this week. You can favorite these tasks, and then filter by Favorited by me to see them.          They are minimal too.   You may ask again, how is it different from followers?   With followers, it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll follow as many tasks as possible in just one project so you can be kept in the loop of all things happening to them. But, you may want to focus on just a few ones important to you silently too. No one does it better than favorites!   And we‚Äôll put the tasks you‚Äôve favorited from all projects into a single place: My Tasks tab in the sidebar.          They are social, obviously.   Favorites can come in handy when you want to see where you team‚Äôs heart lies.   For example, when you made a list of all the possible features you think the new app should have, you can ask your folks to vote it up. So for each winning feature with the highest number of votes, you‚Äôll know they‚Äôre definitely a go!   Worthy to mention here is the difference between ‚ô• and ‚ô°.   A solid heart means you‚Äôve liked the task, whereas an empty heart means you didn‚Äôt like it. The number beside either heart indicates the number of people who‚Äôve liked the task.          Now, you know what you can do with ‚ô•. And it‚Äôs not just for fun.   To summarize it in a sentence, favorite is not just about like but more importantly, about focusing on minimal tasks that matter to you personally.   We hope you ‚ô• it.   Oh and you can choose to turn this feature off in the &quot;Project settings&quot; whenever you want.  ",

        "excerpt": "   Hey, have you tried the recently-released Quire for iOS? If you haven‚Äôt, you‚Äôre missing out on a whole new exciting way to jump start your ideas!   Too often, we have ideas we want to capture at the very moment, and they may be words, photos or scenes that just pass us by and that we‚Äôll most likely forget at the end of the day even if we have a chance to get them down.   The good news is, you have the iOS app to help you with that! Or, to be more precise, the 3-in-1 Snap to Add. By tabbing ‚Äú+‚Äù and choosing whichever option, Camera, Photos or Text, that suits you at the moment, you can bring your ideas into the world!   Here is a demo video:      And we‚Äôve got a few scenarios to show you:   Via Camera. Snap it at the perfect moment.   It was a Thursday morning.   John and his colleagues had a weekly meeting about their next big project, a documentary film of a band‚Äôs huge success in Bell Center, Montreal, as they discussed the stage, lighting, barricade, etc., of the concert.   Did David, who‚Äôs an editor of the film, type or write everything down? Of course not!   He took a shot of the bits and pieces drawn on the whiteboard and added it to their project ‚ÄúDocumentary Film‚Äù to share it with the rest of the team.          Via Photos. Drop it whenever it hits.   Sitting on the floor of a 5-square-meter design studio, Molly and her team were surrounded by piles of clothing and fabrics, brainstorming for the fall-winter 2017/2018 men‚Äôs collection to be presented in a fashion show.   She suddenly remembered the photos she took of the Samburu tribal women in Kenya, and they got her thinking, ‚ÄúIf Alessandro Michele could drew inspiration from cartoon character Snoopy, why can‚Äôt we do the same from them!‚Äù   Right away, she added a photo as task to their project ‚ÄúF-W 2017/2018 Fashion Show.‚Äù It‚Äôs just like what people say, ‚ÄúA picture is worth a thousand words!‚Äù          Via Text. List it in a nested tree.   It‚Äôs always been Lily‚Äôs dream to publish a science fiction novel before she turned 30. Very much like how Veronica Roth did it.   When she was on the plane to New York City, she had an idea for the scene where Demian and his friends need to go to the other side of the world to save Edgar.   Thus, a task named ‚ÄúRescue Scene - Dragon‚Äù was added to her project ‚ÄúDemian the Series‚Äù so she wouldn‚Äôt forget how the heroes and heroines beat the unbeatable red dragon Firmir and could get back to it once she‚Äôs home.          You never know when a great idea might hit you. When it does, you would want to save it in time before it ends up in the black hole of your brain. Get the iOS app now to capture your ideas at any time and place, and take them away anyway you like!  ",

        "excerpt": "   Today, you‚Äôre bound to have a Q-shaped smile on your face, because we‚Äôve got special productivity-boosting tips for everyone, especially those who‚Äôre addicted to keeping your hands on the keyboard! Now, you no longer need to switch between keyboard and mouse while adding and prepping your task.   So what are they? They‚Äôre smart keyboard shortcuts. They can help you add assignees (with @), tags (with #), start and due dates (with &lt;&gt;) and priority (with !) quickly, and more naturally in a single line.   When you add a new task...   You may want to get David to write an article that‚Äôs urgent and is related to marketing by Oct. 2nd.   Simply add a task, and type ‚ÄúWrite the article **@David !1 #Marketing ‚Äù and press Enter.          Your task would, of course, be automatically assigned to David, have a priority of Urgent, a due date of Oct. 2nd and the tag Marketing.          If you want to set a start date as well, simply type &quot;Publish the article @David #Marketing &lt;9/20; 10/2&gt;&quot; and press Enter.   Obviously, when you type @, # or &lt;&gt; (with or without ;), you can use the Up or Down arrow key to select the assignee, tag or start/due date you want.   You can see all the input date formats allowed here.   Note: Priority from high to low is !1, !2, !3 and !4.   When you edit a task‚Ä¶   You may want to add or change the assignee, tag and due date of an existing task.   It‚Äôs like what you‚Äôd do when you‚Äôre adding a new task. For example, you can type ‚ÄúWrite the article @Kevin @Megan &lt;+7d&gt;‚Äù (counting from today) and press Enter.          What happens is that this task would be assigned to both Kevin and Megan instead, and has a new due date of Sept. 30th.          You may also want to add or remove assigness and tags from a task, without having to type them all over again.   To add one more assignee or tag to a task, type +@assignee or +#tag in the task name.   To remove an existing assignee or tag from a task, type -@assignee or -#tag instead.   When you search for tasks...   You can type keywords, assignees (with @), tags (with #) and priority (with !) to search a specific task or more.   You can also hover a task in the search results to highlight it in the tree list.          Wait, there‚Äôs more!   There might be a couple extra useful shortcuts you‚Äôre not aware of.   To add a task, you can simply press Ctrl+Enter. You can even press Tab or Shift+Tab to make it a subtask (indent) or task (unindent) while you&#39;re typing the task name.   After you‚Äôve added a task, you can still move it horizontally by pressing Ctrl+Left or Ctrl+Right. To move it vertically, press Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down.   To delete a task? Like you might have guessed, press Ctrl+Delete.   We‚Äôre bringing you the smart shortcuts because it‚Äôs natural that when you‚Äôre adding a task, you already have an idea who should do it, what priority it should have, and when it should be done. So, instead of choosing them after you add a task, you can now do them all together with @, # and &lt;&gt;.   There are also a whole other shortcuts in store you can check out!  ",

        "title": "A plan well-laid, a party well-played",
        "excerpt": "   ‚ÄúProst!‚Äù cheered the Taiwanese girl Laura, the German guy Richard, and a few dozens people as they banged their glasses of beer together while biting down chicken legs, sausages and pig‚Äôs trotters in a German after-wedding party in a German restaurant a little past 10 on a Saturday night.   But wait! Pause. Rewind. Before this ever happened, there was the ever-so-complicated challenge: the wedding.   From the tiniest things like what sort of forks and knifes should be plated to the bigger questions like inviting friends and family from 4 foreign countries and keeping the party flow from start to end, the couple needed to think, brainstorm, plan, and carry everything out on top of the hideous amount of work they‚Äôre already doing.   To bring about such a wonderful feast, the now happily-married couple had a little help from Quire‚Äôs batch feature. It includes dragging and dropping a single or multiple task(s) to change their order, to move to another project, and to reassign their assignee or multiple assignees, priority and due date in filter view.   The app helped them to:   Pick out the To-dos   We all know fruits should be picked when they‚Äôre mature and that they‚Äôre best to be eaten when fresh. Of course, Laura and her fiance Richard know it too.   This is why they dragged some tasks that should be done first from their ‚Äúplan‚Äù project into their ‚Äúto-dos‚Äù project, completed them in a week, and did the same for the next week, the following week, and so on.          Reschedule the To-dos   It was the 14th of March. Three weeks before the big day. The soon-to-be married couple saw that there were just too many things that needed to be done this week, like that dress that needed to be fixed, the florist to be checked, the number of guests to be confirmed, etc.   Nobody wants to be loaded with work. So, they moved the ones that could be done later to a different due period, and gave them a different due date.          Reassign the To-Dos   One time, Laura‚Äôs sister Megan said it seemed too much work for her to find and book a videographer, make a guest book, choose and pack gifts for dozens of guests, among other things.   Looking at the tasks that each wedding helper was responsible, Laura gave a few of Megan‚Äôs tasks to their cousin David instead.          Reorder the To-dos   ‚ÄúYou know what, these actually don‚Äôt belong here,‚Äù said Laura to Richard as they went through their list of to-dos one last time on a laptop in their shared apartment. You probably hear this a lot yourself.   What happened is they inserted the tasks under a different category, so the updated list made more sense as a whole and was easier for them to follow through.          In a nutshell, one thing that a wedding, or basically any goal or dream you have, can‚Äôt live without is a well-planned and well-organized checklist that can be easily updated, managed and executed. Without it, the process would be bitter and the result wouldn‚Äôt be as sweet as the moments the guests tasted!  ",

        "title": "Time to Break the Myth of ‚ÄúMultiple Assignees‚Äù in Task Management",
        "excerpt": " We often get asked, ‚ÄúCan I assign a task to more than one person?‚Äù Maybe you have this question too. Now the answer is, ‚ÄúYes, you can!‚Äù.   While other task management tools or to-do list apps out there say you may be confused as to who‚Äôs responsible for what or tasks may be overlooked with multiple assignees, we say otherwise: there are times that you don‚Äôt want to bother deciding which member in the team should handle a task or breaking down a task that shouldn‚Äôt need to be broken down into subtasks just so you can assign them individually.   So why did we make it possible on Quire? Check out the three examples below.   Case 1 - Effort to Assign Task   Let‚Äôs say you and your sales team have potential customer inquiries coming in, and three people are responsible for replying them.   If you could assign such task to these three people, they‚Äôd each receive a notification when a new inquiry comes in and any of them could simply pick it up.   Honestly, you wouldn‚Äôt want to make the effort checking your resources, deciding who in the team should do it, or worse, change the habit of how you delegate tasks, just as long as it‚Äôs done by the team.          Case 2 - Hard to Divide Task   You and your co-workers need to make an animated video, and there‚Äôre two graphic designers responsible for the concept of characters.   This task is lacking specific details, like how many characters, what kind of characters and the relations of the characters, for it to become well-defined.   So, imagine going to the trouble of breaking it down when it‚Äôs perfectly alright the way it is.   If you could assign this task to both designers, they‚Äôd be able to work it out among themselves to complete it. This is what teamwork is about.          Case 3 - Not Enough Hands on Deck   Here‚Äôs another scenario that you may have already experienced yourself.   You and your engineering friends have finished building a product, and since it‚Äôs ready for evaluation, you created a task named ‚ÄúReview.‚Äù   Of course, you can assign a person to do it but it‚Äôd be better if more than one do it, so to give you as many feedback as possible. In other words, the more the better.          Now you know, it‚Äôs not always a one-man‚Äôs job when it comes to some tasks. Limiting you to single assignee and asking you to decide who‚Äôs the best person for the job or breaking down a task that doesn‚Äôt actually need to be broken down into smaller ones is frustrating. It‚Äôd also be going against how our minds naturally work.   That‚Äôs why we made assigning people flexible, so you can get the best of both worlds, without having you compromise your usual behaviors or us compromise our simple UI!  ",

So we get that some of you, or your managers, are used to the flexibility of customizing your own reports in a software application you‚Äôre already familiar with: Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.   When it comes to that, you can export your projects into CSV formatted files on Quire.   For example, you and your team members are working on an animated video for a client.          After choosing export to CSV, you‚Äôll get a CSV file.  With the CSV file, you can open it with Excel, Google Sheets or whatever spreadsheet application you prefer, where you‚Äôll see a report with all the project information, including task name, priority, tag, due date, assignee and description, nicely laid out in rows and columns.         Based on this report, you can customize it, like adding colors, and also filters and sorts.   Once you‚Äôve done so, you can see a visual overview of your report, and choose how you‚Äôll see the information that matter to you, i.e., items that have been assigned, have priority Urgent and High, and without the descriptions.          You can also group (sort) the items and sub-items, expand or collapse them, similar to how you‚Äôd have done with the tasks and subtasks in your Quire project.          See, easy as pie.

        "excerpt": " New year comes with an opportunity for you to become a more productive, better and happier person by kicking off the resolutions you set to accomplish.   Having said that, people who set resolutions never expect themselves to follow through. In fact, 25% of them give up by January 7. Here‚Äôs a tip to help you go from making them, to actually keeping them.   First, make a plan.   How many times have you had ideas, but never had the chance to carry them out in the real world?   What you need is a plan. A plan can be an outline where you‚Äôve taken down ideas, divided them into smaller items and organized them in the order you want.          Next, organize the plan.   You now have a plan, which is great. But you may have trouble sticking to it.   The solution is a plan with details like due dates, priorities, tags and assignees, so you‚Äôll know what should be done, when should they be done and who should do them.          Then, execute the plan.   Even with a detailed plan, you may have difficulty figuring out what you should do next.   By selecting your own filter options, you can focus on just a few tasks that need your immediate attention.   And, more importantly, DO them like Shia LaBeuof urges you to do!          So basically, make a plan, organize the plan, and carry out the plan. Don‚Äôt be afraid to change it if something comes up, because you can always add something in or change something, and still focus on what need to be done.   Then, whatever goal you‚Äôve set won‚Äôt be a far-off thing you‚Äôre shooting for!  ",

My friends said I‚Äôm crazy, and my sister said, ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve told me so we can go to Disneyland together!‚Äù   I wouldn‚Äôt call it a spur of the moment, an act of impulse, or even a crime of passion. Traveling alone and be back in one day was just something that‚Äôs been on my bucket list for at least two years and that I‚Äôve never found the right time to do.    Unfortunately, not everything on my bucket list can be scratched off this spontaneously and easily.   Take developing a comic reader app for iPhone and iPad for example. It sounds simple and straightforward but for a writer who has little knowledge about designing and coding and who is only comfortable with spelling words such as Honorificabilitudinitatibus, it‚Äôs more like a daydream than a dream. And yes, I‚Äôve checked out the how to write iOS apps guide on LifeHacker but there‚Äôs only so little I could grasp from it.   Simply put, I can‚Äôt do it alone. Not in a million years.   In my notebooks, I already jotted down ideas of what I imagine this app to look like, to do, and what kind of people it‚Äôll serve, so I need at least a designer, a programmer and a marketing specialist to help me turn them into reality. In as little time as possible.          This is where collaboration kicks in. As a small team of 4 people, other than my Moleskine and Midori notes that came straight from my brain, we still need to find the right tools to help us ease the pains of communication and collaboration, as well as being somewhat remote from one another.   Here are some tools that I (actually we) find helpful:   For Work   As a writer who needs a place to capture the sometimes out-of-nowhere ideas and come up with the masterpieces, I can‚Äôt imagine living without Evernote and Google Doc. You can never anticipate when a new idea might hit and when it does if you‚Äôd just be able to finish wrapping up a long-been-delayed blog post. The same goes for the designer with her graphics editors Photoshop and Illustrator and the programmer with his Xcode and IntelliJ IDEA.   For Tracking and Management   If one or more of your team members are working in a different timezone than yours, a good task tracking and management tool is especially important. What we‚Äôre using right now is Quire, which has integrated with Google Drive and GitHub, thus making a huge difference for me and our programmer Kevin as we rely heavily on them.   For Communication   Also, be it a 4-people meeting or a 1-1 conversation, we need a communication and video tool to discuss the macros and the micros of our iOS app. Skype is a quick and easy way to have team discussion, and Google Hangouts is an excellent choice for 1-1 chats, which happens a lot between our designer Amber and our marketing specialist Cher. A good communication tool is particularly important because we don‚Äôt want to waste the time that each of us has squeezed from our busy schedule wondering what is right and how it should be done on our own.   For Caffeine   Well, this one isn‚Äôt exactly a tool and it‚Äôs not mandatory. For someone who can only appreciate the smell of coffee, I drink tea - black tea and green tea with my favorite being the fruity and flowery Marco Polo from Mariage Fr√®res - that I make in my 12oz DavidsTea Timolino, with a 2.5g of loose tea for 3 minutes and 45 seconds at 96 degree Celcius (no I‚Äôm not picky, it‚Äôs normal for making decent tea) at around 8am and 3pm everyday to keep me awake.   You may already know that working with others is never easy. And it‚Äôs something that every individual has to do at least at some points in their life. But with just the right setup and tools, everyone on the team can easily contribute to a productive team, and a big dream! I‚Äôd love to hear your experience collaborating with your team members. What‚Äôs going well and what isn‚Äôt?  ",

        "title": "Why Focusing On Productivity Makes You Less Productive",
        "excerpt": "   You are the most productive person you know. Your phone is filled with to-do lists and productivity apps. You‚Äôre busy all the time. Your appointment calendar barely has an empty spot. If there ever was a picture of someone who is getting things done, it‚Äôs you. You‚Äôre the poster child for productivity.   Except that you aren‚Äôt getting all that much done. Truth be told, if anyone bothered to check, your output isn‚Äôt all that great, and you can‚Äôt figure out why.   Being busy doesn‚Äôt mean being productive. It may simply mean you are using up all of your time doing things but not necessarily getting things done. What keeps productivity fans like yourself from being productive?   1. Working More Hours   If productivity could be reduced to the simplest numbers, you might measure it in hours.   High output isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs how businesses function and how things get done. But a focus on high output as measured by time dedicated to work is the wrong approach. Too many productive people think pulling long hours is a badge of honor for productivity.   The truth is, working more hours in a day is detrimental.   Research by John Pencavel, of Stanford University, has shown that working beyond 50 hours a week leads to a noticeable drop off of output. Once you hit 55 hours a week, that reduction plummets even more sharply. Even Henry Ford realized that longer hours hurt productivity as tired employees worked slower and with less accuracy. Ford slashed work hours down to 40 hours to increase output.   Employers pay for the extra hours. Employees give up valuable personal time with family and for rest, and what do they have to show for all of that productivity? Not much at all.   This is tough to believe today, particularly in the tech world where blurring the lines between work and play to encourage people to stay at the office longer is an accepted norm. Just remember, you‚Äôd be better off working less than 50 hours a week, with 40 hours a week being the sweet spot for steady output.   Fewer hours, more output. Measure the output, not the hours.   2. Working More Efficiently   Being efficient is part of being productive, but there is a particularly onerous misconception about what is required to be efficient. Namely, the need to multitask.   Is multi-tasking part of using your time more efficiently? Most people would answer yes, believing the myth that being efficient with time means doing several things at once. After all, you can get three things done in the time it would take you to do one, right?   Nope.   Multitasking is a horrible beast when it comes to actually being productive. Your brain can‚Äôt actually multitask, only capable of truly doing one thing at a time. By trying to make multiple things happen, you are inducing high levels of stress in yourself. Multitasking destroys your focus, trains your brain to short circuit its ability to concentrate, encourages you to cut corners and avoid detail-oriented work, and in the end, reduces your output by 40 percent.   Not one thing on that list of multitasking negatives promotes productivity, yet most people consider multitasking to be a crucial component to being efficient. The truth is, working more efficiently really means one thing: no more multitasking. You must focus on only one thing at one time.   Part of working more efficiently, once you get rid of multitasking, is understanding your own willpower and the need to say ‚Äúno‚Äù once in awhile. Gregory Ciotti, from the Sparring Mind blog, agrees with the importance of doing one thing at a time, but adding that you must make sure that you are doing the right thing.   The right thing, of course, is the project you have to finish first. That‚Äôs it. This is a question of keeping your focus, and that is going to require saying ‚Äúno‚Äù frequently when distractions or new work is about to be dumped in your lap.   3. Addicted To The Idea Of Productivity   Focusing on productivity can lead to a strange addiction, particularly for people who are hyper-organized and perfectionists. They know (and have probably tried) every productivity app, notebook, system, and device around. They are not so much productive as they are addicted to the idea that they could be if they only found the perfect system. In other words, they are addicted to the idea of productivity.   They spend a lot of time reading books and blogs and listening to podcasts about being productive. They memorize systems that will help them get things done. They write endless lists, and are always mindful that there might be a better alternative to their current system so they must stay on the lookout. They read any blog post that promises yet another ‚Äúproductivity hack‚Äù, thinking there‚Äôs a shortcut they missed.   The key to productivity is to find a system that works, yes, but to stop chasing after something new or better. You don‚Äôt get things done by fussing around with new apps and systems, or by constantly reading about how to be more productive or how to hack an otherwise good habit that has worked for you for years.   Choose a system that helps you get things done and stay focused, whatever that system looks like for you. Stick with it. Chasing after a continual promise of something better is a distraction.   Change Your Focus From Productivity   How do you get things done?   You do them.   It is so easy to think that being busy and doing lots of things at once means being productive, but most often it merely means you‚Äôre simply busy and distracted. Stop being infatuated with the idea of productivity (and all of its trappings), and instead focus on what needs to be done until it is done.   ",

        "title": "How an impossible mission was made possible",
        "excerpt": "   I remember in the movie The Imitation Game, after Joan Clarke showed up late for the evaluation that involved solving a difficult crossword puzzle, Allen said to Manzies: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about crossword puzzles. It‚Äôs about how one approaches solving an impossible problem. Do you take the whole thing at once or divide it into small.‚Äù   We asked ourselves a similar question awhile back. But it was more of an ‚Äúimpossible mission‚Äù rather than an ‚Äúimpossible problem.‚Äù We asked ourselves: ‚ÄúSo...how should we do this? Do we just jump at it or break it down first?‚Äù   It was about a few weeks ago, my friend Neiko, who is a television reporter, and I suddenly had this crazy idea of creating a 90-min film about the beauty of Taiwan - not just of its sceneries, but also its culture, traditions and people.   I watched the long-anticipated Taiwanese documentary Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above with two others friends Iris and Jason. But I fell asleep ‚Öì through the film. There were no flow, no plot, no climax for me. The English subtitles were poorly done by the way.   So it got me thinking. Why not create one that has more logic and story to it?   Neiko and I were both excited about it, but feeling lost at the same time. Yes, she works with a camera and I with a pen. Yet, it felt like there were so much to do - coming up with a script, finding the right actors, renting and borrowing the places and equipments, etc., and we had no idea where or how we should start.   With just the script alone, all sorts of ideas came pouring down on us like heavy rains: we want to film the views from the rear of the train, starting with Pingtung, the southest point of Taiwan, and ending with Taipei; we want to drop by each major city and town along the way to shoot the local sceneries; we want to talk to Taiwanese aborigines about the now and then - and hopefully get a glimpse into how the Amis people contributed to the chant in the popular international hit ‚ÄúReturn to Innocence‚Äù - and visit Hakka people living in Hsinchu and Miaoli; we want to include the fireworks on New Year‚Äôs Eve at Taipei 101...The list kept going.   Staring at the notes scribbled on the pieces of paper, we wondered: ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs next‚Äù?   If it were Allen, the same Allen, not the one who created GTD, he probably would‚Äôve just taken the whole 90-minute video and divided it into step-by-step actions in 6 minutes. We aren‚Äôt that smart though, so this was what we did: after we thought about it and got all the ideas down, we organized them into categories and broke them down into doable items and further into smaller actions.   Things definitely looked brighter after the whole scary thing was broken down into little pieces. Of course, it would still take time and possibly help from others to complete all the steps and, ultimately, achieve our goal: a 90-minute video with just as much beauty and twist of tales and smiles, but at least the mission looked possible now.   Today, be it at work or in life, we meet problems, face goals and have dreams that are not entirely impossible but at least challenging to solve or achieve. Do we confront them all at once? Or do we divide them into pieces and conquer them one by one? It‚Äôs a question you should ask yourself.  ",

        "title": "Your time comes with a price tag",
        "excerpt": "   I have a bucket list.   I‚Äôve always wanted to learn the guitar and Japanese, backpack in Europe, go bungee jumping, and publish a book. However, it seems I can always find excuses to postpone them: I don‚Äôt have the time, I don‚Äôt have enough money, I don‚Äôt know where to begin, etc.   This is why almost 10 years later, my dream of writing a book and having it published before I turn 20 never became a reality.   I don‚Äôt want to waste another 10 years! It was time for a change.   I‚Äôve heard and read about the GTD method, and so I‚Äôve decided to try a simpler version of it based on Chris Winfield‚Äôs system to help me cross this long-delayed dream off my list.   I call it the 4 Ds:          1. Dream it. Know the big picture    ‚ÄúIf you can dream it, you can do it.‚Äù Walt Disney    First, imagine your ideal life. What do you really want from life? What are your ambitions and dreams? It can be anything you‚Äôve always wanted to do, have or achieve.   For example, you might want to learn a new language, travel around the world, do an extreme sport, be your own boss, publish a book, build your dream house, and so on.   It‚Äôs okay to just have a vision of who you want to be, what you want to do and where you want to be for now. Don‚Äôt worry about not knowing how to get there. You can fill in the details later.          2. Dump it. Get all your ideas down   Once you have a the big picture, thoughts, ideas and questions will naturally come to you.   In my case, the first thing that came to my mind was I wanted to write a story of young superheroes and superheroines fighting against a supervillain but the bad guy falls in love with the good girl and they - very much like Bellamy and Clarke from The 100 -  run off together and live happily ever after (I know it sounds a bit ridiculous).   Next, I asked myself what should the plot be, what is the climax, how many chapters I should have, how many pages I should write, what publisher I should submit my story to, etc.   The key here is to get your ideas down before they fade away.   Simply use your Lamy or Moleskine to write them down. They can be messy and ugly, but that‚Äôs okay. Or, if you‚Äôre more comfortable typing on a computer, TextEdit, Notepad or Google Doc is a good choice too. Free note-taking apps like Evernote are great as well, and it even works on your smartphone.          3. Divide it. Organize, categorize and divide   Now that you‚Äôve gotten your ideas down, it‚Äôs time to organize, categorize and break them down into actions.   Outliner apps especially one with unlimited number and levels of tasks like Quire will be helpful at this point.   For example, I‚Äôve created my dream project named ‚ÄúMy Book‚Äù and inside it a task ‚ÄúCharacters‚Äù with children tasks including ‚ÄúNames and personalities‚Äù and ‚ÄúA character relationship chart.‚Äù The former children task was further broken down into ‚ÄúProtagonists,‚Äù ‚ÄúAntagonists‚Äù and ‚ÄúOthers.‚Äù   I‚Äôve also added specifics, such as due date and tag like In-Progress or Later, to each task , so I know what should be done first and what should have my attention.          4. Do it. Complete each task one by one   This is the step that‚Äôll take the most time, as you‚Äôll need to conquer each task one by one, starting from the easiest to the most challenging.   Obviously, the easiest task for me was to come up with the names for my characters, and the most difficult one that I‚Äôll definitely need help with and I‚Äôm saving for later is finding a publisher that‚Äôd be willing to publish my book.   The good thing is that when even the most challenging task has been further broken down into simple ones like ‚ÄúSearch for appropriate publishers‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmail appropriate publishers‚Äù, what seemed terrifying, isn‚Äôt so terrifying.   When you‚Äôve started your dream project, a review of it will help you stay on track.   Every Sunday afternoon, I spend 10 minutes to review my work. I start by collapsing the tasks, so I only see the first-level tasks without being disturbed or overwhelmed by the details. Next, I zoom in to see each task, adding new ones and reordering them. Then, I remove the tag ‚ÄúIn-Progress‚Äù from those I‚Äôve finished over the past week, mark them complete, and add the same tag to the ones that should be done in the upcoming week.   See, it didn‚Äôt take days or months for my dream to look realistic. It isn‚Äôt so far away now, because I‚Äôve finally started somewhere, and can clearly see where I‚Äôm heading.   Time isn‚Äôt free, you‚Äôre paying it with your life. Instead of wasting it on imaging what your dream would be like in your head, make it happen. In reality.   So what are you waiting for? Create your own bucket list and follow these steps yourself!  ",

One way to do this and not be distracted by the remaining tasks is via the ‚Äúfilter‚Äù function. Simply decide how you would like to see your tasks, and follow the steps.   First, click on the filter icon‚Ä¶   By clicking on the filter icon below the project‚Äôs name, you will see a menu bar.          There, you can choose what kinds of tasks you would like to see, sort (aka group) and filter them further.

Or we can just get straight to the hows:   1. Click on the Assignee icon.          2. Turn on the switch button besides ‚ÄúAssign an external team‚Äù.          3. Click on ‚Äú+ Add new team‚Äù.          4. Enter a name for the external team.          5.

The external members you have invited will need to accept the email invitations you have just sent.   Once they have done so, you would have successfully assigned the task to them, and they would be able to start working on it.   When you work on your project, you will see the whole picture.

When your external team work on the same project, they will see only the assigned task. So, you do not need to worry about them seeing your other tasks.          That said, external members can still create subtasks under the assigned task and manage them.          And so can you.          ‚ÄúExternal team‚Äù is a useful feature for those of you who want to focus on the core tasks at hand while delegating those that are non-core to third parties without compromising your safety.   In our upcoming reports, we will go into more details of what you and your external members can do.   Please stay tuned!  ",

        "title": "I Don‚Äôt Really Know Them, But I Need Their Help",
        "excerpt": "   In reality, there is not just you and me. There is also them.   Yes, we can survive on our own, but there will definitely be times when we need other people‚Äôs help, especially with something we cannot handle, whether it is at work or at home.   But getting help can be a tricky thing. You would not want to have a plumber helping you repair a break in the bathroom and also going into your bedroom doing all sorts of crazy things you cannot even imagine.   And as a project manager, not only would you want a freelancer to only access tasks that are outsourced to him or her, you would also want to include the outsourced tasks into your project to see the whole picture.   This is where Quire‚Äôs ‚Äúexternal team‚Äù feature comes in.   ‚ÄúExternal team‚Äù is a group of people who work on the task(s) you outsource to them.   To get an idea of what it is and what it does, take a look at the example below.   You want to promote your new product and you think having an animation video for it would help, so you outsource this task to an animation studio.   Having received the task, the animation studio would then break it down into smaller tasks like storyline and characters and decide who is responsible for what and when among their designers and artists.   While they are busy doing all that at their end, you and your team members would work on some other promotion strategies.   In this example, the animation studio is your external team, and the designers and artists are your external members.   You give them enough freedom to manage the assigned task, and, at the same time, making sure that they do not have the freedom to access your other tasks.   Overall, ‚Äúexternal team‚Äù is a one-of-a-kind feature for those of you who want to stay worry-free and in control when getting outside help to help you finish a project.   For more details, you can check out Quire‚Äôs guide on external team.  ",

        "excerpt": "   For some of you, it is difficult enough to keep everyone up to date with the tasks at hand. It is even more so when they involve codes. Lots of codes.   But not to worry, Quire has got it covered. With the integration with GitHub, it is easier to stay on top of your team members‚Äô code changes and to refer and trace back between tasks and codes.   How do I integrate with GitHub?    Go to Quire &amp; Beyond     Choose Github and click on Install     Choose the project that you would like to integrate Github to     Authorize your Github account with Quire     Choose the Github repositories you want to connect to Quire     Successfully integrated Github with Quire       Once you are back to your project, the integration is done!   What can I do with GitHub integration?   You can reference and complete a task or more via commit message.   To reference a task:   First, choose a task.      Find the ID for this task in the url bar.          Tip: You can press Ctrl (or Alt for Mac) to see all task IDs.   You enter a # and the task ID in the commit message.   For example:  Write #634.  When you make a reference, we will add a comment to the task like this:          Note that whenever we add a comment to Quire, we will also add one to GitHub:          Now, you can easily refer to the task from GitHub to Quire, and trace its codes from Quire to GitHub.   You can also add a message at the end of your commit.   For example:  Edit #634 added more description.  Then, it will appear like this in the task‚Äôs comment:          To reference multiple tasks:   Follow the same steps for referencing a task, and simply add ‚Äúand‚Äù in your commit message.   For example:  Edit #634, #635 and #636 paraphrased a few sentences.  It will look like this in all three tasks:          To complete a task:   Again, first select a task.          Find the task ID in the url bar.          Use any of the keywords below followed by a # and the task ID in your commit message.   For example:  Close #634 article finalized.  Keywords:  Complete/Completes/Completed Close/Closes/Closed Fix/Fixes/Fixed Resolve/Resolves/Resolved  When you complete a task, we will add a comment to the task like this:          And we will mark the task as complete:          To complete multiple tasks:   Follow the same steps for closing a task, and add ‚Äúand‚Äù in your commit message.   For example:  Close #635 and #636 articles finalized.  When you complete these two tasks, we will add the same comment to both tasks:          And we will mark both tasks as complete:          I hope you will enjoy our very first integration with GitHub and that it will help you keep everyone in the loop.

        "title": "Our Very Own Markdown",
        "excerpt": "   You may have heard of Markdown. If you have, it is a good thing. It can create rich texts, like in Microsoft Word, easily and quickly. For those of you who do not know what it is, here is the introduction by its creator, John Gruber (of Daring Fireball): http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/   So, we have Markdown. Precisely, Quire‚Äôs own flavored Markdown.   Follow these 3 steps to see a few examples:   Go to any task -&gt; Add description or comment (or click on Edit) -&gt; Click on the ‚Äú?‚Äù mark   Voila! A pop-up of our markdown list:          Want to add emphasis? You can either use * (wow!) for italic, or two asterisks (wow!) for bold.   To create a list, add an asterisk and a space before your items. It is just like what you would do if you were using Word or Page, but easier and quicker.   Wait, there‚Äôs more!   Sometimes, words just are not enough. Thankfully, you can use emoji icons in the description and comment of a task. If you type a colon, a list of emoji will automatically show up:          Talk about being ‚Äúexpressive‚Äù!   Next is something you will definitely find useful.   When you want to refer someone to a particular task, just enter @username and then #taskname. All the tasks containing the letters you have typed will show up. Simply find the right one.          This way, there is no more copying and posting the URL of a task.   Now that you have seen what our Markdown can do, see the cheat sheet below and give it a go!     Markdown Cheat Sheet   HEADERS   Quire‚Äôs Markdown supports two styles of headers, Setext and Atx.   Setext-style headers use equal signs (for first-level headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). For example:  H1 == H2 --  Atx-style headers use 1‚Äì6 number signs at the start of the line, followed by 1‚Äì6 header levels. For example:  # H1 ## H2 ### H3 #### H4 ##### H5 ###### H6  LINE BREAKS   To generate a new line, you press ENTER.   HORIZONTAL RULES   You can produce a horizontal rule by typing 3 or more hyphens, asterisks or underscores, with space in between if you like:  *** * * * - ‚Äî -  ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî   EMPHASIS   You use asterisks to indicate emphasis.   For italic, you use 1 asterisk. For example:  This is *important*.  For bold, you use 2 asterisks. For example:  This is **very important**.  UNDERLINES   You can use one underscore at the start and the end of the text:  _Underlined text._  STRIKETHROUGHS   You can use one tilde at the start and the end of the text:  ~Delete text.~  LISTS   Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.   Order list uses numbers and periods like:  1. step1 2. step2 3. step3  Unordered list like:  * item1 * item2 * item3  is the same as:  + item1 + item2 + item3  and:  - item1 - item2 - item3  Each item may consist of multiple paragraphs. To add a paragraph in a list item, indent 4 spaces or 1 tab like this:  1. step1     I‚Äôm a paragraph. 2. step2 3. step3  LINKS   You use square brackets to delimit the text and round brackets for the link. For example,  This is a [Google link](https://www.google.com/)  Markdown also supports 3 variants of links. First is a title for your link:  [Google link with title](http://google.com/ ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù)  Second is the reference-style link that uses second set of square brackets that contain an id you choose for the link:  I use [Google][id1] more than I use [Yahoo][id2].  Then, anywhere in the text, you define your link id:  [id1]: http://google.com/ ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù [id2]: http://search.yahoo.com/ ‚ÄúGood‚Äù  The third is an automated Link. You can simply write down a link, Markdown will turn it into a clickable link:  Google: http://google.com/  IMAGES   Markdown supports two styles of images: inline and reference.   Inline image syntax looks like this:  ![alt text](path/to/image.jpg) ![alt text](path/to/image.jpg ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù)  You write down an exclamation mark, a set of square brackets containing an alt attribute text for the image, a second set of square brackets containing the URL or path to the image, and an optional title attribute enclosed in double quotes.   Reference image syntax looks like this:  ![alt text][id] [id]: url/to/image.jpg ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù  In this style of writing, ‚Äúid‚Äù is the name of a defined image reference, which is defined in the same way as link references.   TABLES   You can create tables using | (pipes) and - (hyphens).   Pipes are used to separate each column and hyphens create each column‚Äôs header.   So, if you type:  | 1st Header | 2nd Header | | ---------- | ---------- | | text       | text       | | text       | text       |  It will turn out like this:     1st Header 2nd Header    text text   text text    Tip: You can type &lt;br&gt; to break a line in a table cell, and \\&lt;br&gt; to keep &lt;br&gt; in the cell.   ESCAPE PIPE   You may want to escape a pipe in a table cell. It can be done easily with \\ in front of the pipe.   For example, if you type:  | Left   | Right | | :------ | ------:| | A | text A | | B | text B | | C | text C \\| word C |  It will look like this:          BLOCKQUOTES   Blockquotes are indicated using ‚Äú&gt;‚Äù angle brackets.  &gt; I‚Äôm part of a very long quote. But I‚Äôll still be quoted properly when I wrap.  Also, blockquotes can rest in blockquotes by adding levels of angle brackets:  &gt; I‚Äôm the first level of quote. &gt;&gt; I‚Äôm the second level of quote. &gt; I‚Äôm back at the first level.  CHECKLISTS   You can create your own checklist by typing - [ ]  - [ ] Checklist item 1 - [ ] Checklist item 2 - [ ] Checklist item 3  With Quire checklist, you can tick off your checklist as well.        Take my dog for a walk    Do laundry   PHONE NUMBERS  (415) 555-2671 (415)5552671 (415) 555 2671 +14155552671 020 7183 8750 0923-234-7890 09232347890  You can type in the phone numbers in one of the above format and the system will generate a hyperlink to make a call.    CODE   To indicate a span of code, wrap it with ‚Äú`‚Äù backtick quotes. For example,  Use two asterisks `**` for bold.  To include backtick characters in a code, you use multiple backtick quotes and spaces‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone after the opening and one before the closing‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike this:  Use two asterisks `` `**` `` for bold.  CODE BLOCK   You can generate a code block by indenting 4 spaces or 1 tab:  I‚Äôm a normal paragraph.     I‚Äôm a code block. I&#39;m a normal paragraph.  Or type 3 backticks in the beginning and the end of the text like this:  I‚Äôm a normal paragraph. ``` I‚Äôm a code block. ``` I‚Äôm a normal paragraph.  Remember to break the line before and after the backticks.   SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING   We take code block one step further by adding Syntax Highlighting.   For example, if you define CSS as your content language:  ```css h1 {  font-size: 2.5em;  font-weight: normal; } ```  Or if you choose Javascript as your content language:  ```javascript var setArray = function(elems) {  this.length = 0;  push.apply(this, elems);  return this; } ```  You will see that it displays text in different colors according to the content language you chose, making it easier for programmers and developers to read.   CSS Styles   You can add CSS style to text in task name, description and comment with {css-style| text}.   For instance, if you type:  {color: red, font-size:20px|color text}  It will turn out like this:          Characters   You can now add characters too via HTML entities.   Let&#39;s say you type:  &amp;yen;, &amp;reg;, &amp;#8451; and &amp;#x263B;  It will turn out like this:   &yen;, &reg;, &#8451; and &#x263B;   BACKSLASH ESCAPES   We let you use \\ (backslash) to surround text with characters, so you can escape the characters‚Äô general meaning.   For example, if you want to surround a word with asterisks, use backslashes before the asterisks:  \\*literal asterisks\\*  Then, it will turn out like this:  *literal asterisks*  We support backslash escapes for the following characters:    \\   backslash `   backtick *   asterisk _   underscore {}  curly braces []  square brackets ()  parentheses #   hash mark +   plus sign -   hyphen .   dot !   exclamation mark   YOUTUBE VIDEOS   Youtube videos can be added if you add an image with a link to the video:  [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)  Please stay tuned for more to come!

        "title": "3 Reasons to Be and Stay Lazy",
        "excerpt": "   I‚Äôm a lazy person (let‚Äôs be honest here, who isn‚Äôt).   Though my parents keep telling me ever since I turned 18 that it‚Äôs a very bad habit, I‚Äôm confident that it‚Äôs the key to a better life, and a better future.   Here are my reasons:   1. Save Time   Being lazy means you will find ways or means to get more things done in lesser time efficiently.   If I can express my feelings in two words, I wouldn‚Äôt use three; if I can make a delicious grilled cheese sandwich in three steps, I wouldn‚Äôt make it four.   Or if I want to create a detailed list of my favorite restaurants in the city, I wouldn‚Äôt bother writing it down in a notebook, like my non-tech savvy auntie did.   With so many top task management tools out there, including Asana, Basecamp and Quire, it‚Äôs actually quite easy to do so.   2. Less Waste   Being lazy means you are less likely to buy stuff, and thus less likely to throw them away.   I remember two years ago, I had to move from an apartment to another every three months, and with each time that I moved, I carried lesser and lesser belongings with me.   Now, I find myself disliking the idea of buying more goods, since it always makes me feel like adding unnecessary weight onto my shoulders.   Why buy a new T-shirt when you‚Äôve already got enough to wear for one week? It‚Äôd be like having the extra credit card that you‚Äôll never use in your purse.   3. More Fun   Once you save yourself time and energy, it‚Äôs no doubt that you‚Äôll have more time for other things and people.   For example, you can have dinners with your families, watch DVDs with your friends, go camping with your dog, and even learn something new.   In all, I think laziness is a good thing.   If you‚Äôre like me, you like getting things done fast without burdening yourself and still having the time for activities and games, let‚Äôs be lazy, or stay lazy.  ",

        "title": "Turning task managers into a foodie‚Äôs best friend!",
        "excerpt": "   When most people come across a ‚Äútask management tool‚Äù or ‚Äútask manager‚Äù, they instantly build up this vivid framework - task managers are strictly for work only, and they don‚Äôt think much else of it. Admittedly, I was also one of those people until 2 weeks ago, until I realized there are actually so many different ways you can utilize a task manager once you jump out of that circle and what you create actually becomes very handy!    I turned mine into a foodie‚Äôs most treasured list!    As a foodie, I love eating and I love trying out new restaurants. I have the habit of keeping a list of restaurants including ones I&#39;ve been and like, or ones I&#39;ve heard/read somewhere and would like to go sometime in the future. Before Quire, I tried different restaurant apps but none of them really appealed to me simply because    Performance was not ideal I really only need a personal pocket list of selected restaurants, the excess restaurant recommendations on the apps becomes redundant to me. Do not have control over the list‚Äô s order, categorization, filter etc (cannot customize). UI is somewhat messy   After some try outs, I just decided to stick with iPhone‚Äôs inbuilt Notes app. It‚Äôs convenient no doubt as I could access it everywhere but I didn&#39;t find it was the best way for several reasons:    It is not as easy (compared to PC) to type/copy and paste on a smartphone. Although you could use iCloud on PC but the synchronization can be inaccurate sometimes and would create multiple copies of the same note. If I wanted to add a website URL, an address/phone number of the restaurant, the list gets messy.   These two reasons I can still deal with, but the next two are critical reasons why I moved my list to Quire.    Categorization is not really possible. When the list got too long, I wanted to categorize them according to the types of cuisines but there‚Äôs no ‚Äúlayer‚Äù or ‚Äúlevel‚Äù concept in Notes which makes it difficult to distinguish. The workaround was to add # in front of each categorization to identify it as a header but the result is not clean nor ideal (see below).           Filtering by location is not possible.    So‚Ä¶ this is where Quire comes in.    Originally I was only using Quire as my task manager for work. I never thought it could become part of my personal life too! It started when I was planning for a trip and was listing down all the possible restaurants I‚Äôd like to visit.    First, I listed them according to their types (for example‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämodern, french, Japanese, dessert etc.). Secondly, for convenient purposes I wanted to group them by location so that when I‚Äôm planning for each day‚Äôs activities I could plan sightseeing places and restaurants of the same area together to avoid running back and forth.   To do that I had to create yet another list and sort them by location manually!!   Suddenly I thought ‚Äúwait..why don‚Äôt I try Quire?!‚Äù. So I started organizing my list into Quire and I thought    This is exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for all along!!    Take a sneak peak:    A nice &amp; clean list, information can be viewed at one glance           As you can see from the above, I put cities at a project level so I have many different projects on the side bar featuring cities around the world (illustrated below).          Then, taking advantage of Quire‚Äôs tree structured task list I make each ‚Äòtask‚Äô a type of cuisine (Modern, French, Italian, Japanese, Asian, Desserts etc.) and list down sub-tasks under each task as the corresponding restaurants under that particular category. You can also collapse or extend them at will.          So this fulfills my wish of having a nice and clean list in which I can view the details at once (most task managers requires you to click into a particular task to see its sub-tasks).    Filtering by Location    Now, what with ‚Äòfiltering by location?‚Äù Some of you may have already guessed judging by the screenshots‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätags. Yep, that‚Äôs right! When organizing my list, I tagged each restaurants by their location (some may have several tags as they have several branches) and then I simply use the filtering mechanism provided by Quire‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso simple!   Take an example, I wanted to eat around Upper East Side‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI go to the filter bar at the top -&gt; filtered by -&gt; tags -&gt; Upper East Side and boom! I‚Äôll have every restaurant located in the Upper East Side at my command in less than a second! A simpler way is you just click on the tag itself and you will achieve the same result.           Restaurant information viewed in detail panel    Previously, I had a hard time keeping my list clean also because I wanted to include reference URLs, addresses, phone numbers etc. Now with Quire, I simply put them in the detail panel (illustrated below) on the right of each ‚Äòtask‚Äô to keep the list simple and clean!           Access it everywhere    Quire is web-based which means you can also access it everywhere‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat home, at work and on the go!    It‚Äôs your turn now!    So, this is my story turning into my ‚Äòdull‚Äô task manager into something so great I couldn&#39;t have foreseen before. The sharing and collaboration feature also makes it super handy when me and my friend exchange each other‚Äôs restaurant list for reference. We share our list and make notes or comments to exchange our thoughts on the restaurants in the detail panel in real time!   I&#39;ve made some of my projects public so you to take a closer look, any comments on the idea or on the restaurants are more than welcome (you will need to sign up in order to leave a comment)!    New York City Brisbane Hong Kong   You can also share with us how you&#39;ve utilized your task manager in all the different ways possible!     Let creativity and imagination blow your mind!  ",

        "title": "WOW moments of Quire!",
        "excerpt": "   Have you ever experienced the   ‚Äúwow! moment‚Äù   when playing apps on your phone or working on a computer?   Like when you realise you can simply swipe left to go back to the previous page without having to touch the ‚Äúback‚Äù button on the facebook app or instagram. The first time you could @name someone, the first time when auto-complete came out.   Or if we go back in time a little bit further‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe first time you found out about ‚ÄúAlt+Tab‚Äù, the first time you ever used ‚Äúctrl+z‚Äù to retrieve something you&#39;ve typed, the first time you used ‚ÄúF2&quot; to rename something, or even the first time you realise how powerful drag and drop can be.   These handy features and keyboard shortcuts make our daily operation much easier and eventually become so intuitive that we automatically search for these keys and shortcuts in new apps and systems.   In short, they improve our user experience.   In the development of Quire, we also kept this an important aspect, to create some handy features based on these common shortcuts and UX to make the app as intuitive and convenient as possible.   Many of us, including me, don‚Äôt like to move our hands away from the keyboard unless we absolutely have to, this is not because we‚Äôre lazy, it‚Äôs because we simply don‚Äôt want to interrupt our thoughts when a flow of ideas come rushing through our brain. (This really isn&#39;t just an excuse !! )   And how is this important to task management?   Imagine when you‚Äôre breaking down a project inside your brain and try listing down all the tasks in their relative places and structure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyes exactly, you don‚Äôt want to be interrupted in the process.   Hence!!   Quire provides the same or similar user experience to what you have inherited over the years to make task management flow like a river~   Let‚Äôs take a tour at some of the amazing wow! moments you may find in Quire.   Keyboard Shortcuts!          For me personally, I love ‚ÄúENTER, F2&quot;, ‚ÄúCTRL+ ENTER‚Äù, ‚ÄúCTRL + ‚Üê‚Äù and ‚ÄúCTRL + ‚Üí‚Äù. These shortcuts have proven so useful when listing down tasks. For example, when I type something wrong, I can easily use ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù or ‚ÄúF2&quot; to edit the task name like how you can change a file name easily in any Windows OS. After that, I simply use ‚ÄúCTRL+ ENTER‚Äù to add another task and finally, ‚ÄúCTRL + ‚Üê‚Äù and ‚ÄúCTRL + ‚Üí‚Äù also comes in very handy when you forget to ‚ÄúSHIFT + ENTER‚Äù for a new sub-task or when you want to adjust the level of your task. During the whole process, I can focus 100% on the content of my task without having to pull my hand away from the keyboard for trivial edits.   Auto-complete!   Like many social media platforms, Quire also supports the auto-complete function in order to create a more lively interaction and user experience. You know that @name function where you can mention someone on Facebook and Twitter? And the beauty of it is that it gives you a list of names available according to the letter you have typed! At the time I thought, wow! how convenient ?! We leverage this in Quire too! It comes in very practical when you want someone‚Äôs attention on a particular task. It could be a task you‚Äôre committed to but wish to consult the person for some suggestions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsimply @name that person in a description or comment, he or she will be notified immediately.          So, now you say what about when you want to mention a particular task to someone? No problem! Simply #taskname, all the tasks containing the letter you have typed will show up, your job is to simply find the right one. No more copying URL of one task to post into the comment or description of another task.          To make work less stressful and team work more enjoyable, emoticons are available in Quire! If you type &quot;:&quot;, a list of emoticons we now support will pop up, find the most suitable one and press down that ENTER button of yours to add a little bit more fun at work!          Drag &amp; Drop!   As much as we like our keyboards, mouse is also something that can‚Äôt be ignored. A simple drag and drop act can be very powerful, saving us many clicks and inconveniences. In this aspect, Quire provides a unique experience for users. Apart from the most common ones you see in most task management tools, e.g. you can drag and drop a file into the description or comment area to upload, or drag and drop to rearrange the order of the tasks, Quire also provides the following to empower task management;   (1) drop task B on top of task A to become the child (sub-task) of task A          Note: this concept is derived from Windows‚Äô desktop behaviour, like how you can drop a folder on top of another to make it a sub-folder inside the folder you have dropped on top of.          (2) drag forward or backward horizontally to change its relationship with another task          (3) drag a task with sub-tasks, it will collapse and move the whole tree to where you drop it. The hierarchy of the tasks will thus, not be affected.   For example, if we drag task C on top of task B, the relationship of task C &amp; D remains.          So, these are my wow moments with Quire, if you are amazed by its convenience, you can try Quire here it‚Äôs totally free! And remember, to share your wow! moments with us too! ‚ò∫   Thanks to Eric Brecht.  ",

        "title": "Make your Product Backlog Speak the Whole Story",
        "excerpt": "   The Conventional Product Backlog   contains an ordered list of requirements often written in a User Story form. These fragmented ‚Äústories‚Äù do not give us a clear picture of what the Product is, or what values they bring as a whole. The Product Owner, the Development Team and stakeholders all depend on this backlog to fill their roles in Scrum yet this very backbone which they rely on does not present a mental image of the product that‚Äôs needed for the team to bring out the product‚Äôs value or advantage.   Imagine you‚Äôre a stakeholder of our latest task management software‚Äî Quire   and you‚Äôll have access to a Product Backlog that, by convention, looks something like the list below:          Each of these user stories is self sufficient in portraying a requirement; however, by sorting them with respect to their Return On Investment, we&#39;ve taken each item out of their context‚Äîthe core value that they contribute to the product.   Instead, let‚Äôs try a different approach in creating a Product Backlog for Quire, with Quire    We first put down the core values that drive the development of our product:           Although these ‚Äúepics‚Äù are too large to be estimated with any reliable accuracy, they do paint a better picture of what values this product would bring.    We then expand on each epic, specifying more stories, or even more epics, that would build on top of these foundations toward our product:           Notice this tree-like structure fits naturally with how we had developed our ideas. If we make the analogy that the product is a tree, then the the epics would be the main branches of the tree. With the conventional Product Backlog, we are picking up a leaf here and there at the ends, stacking them up without seeing what the whole tree looks like.   With Quire‚Äôs tree structure, we can nest stories within other stories(or epics) so we‚Äôre always made aware of their context and not lose focus on what value we wish to bring forth in the product.    But we are supposed to prioritize the Product Backlog Items?    The convention dictates that we put the Product Backlog Item with highest priority on the top of the list; but there are other alternatives to highlight our immediate concerns than a sorted list.   We can define priority level tags such as PL1, PL2, and so on; upon the Product Owner gets all the necessary information to prioritize the tasks, he or she can assign these tags to tasks that are in considerations for the upcoming Sprints:          Although it‚Äôs best to estimate efforts on tasks as a group in a meeting room, with team members often reside on different continents, Quire‚Äôs live chat feature is a good alternative   During the Spring Planning Meeting, when it comes to picking the items to commit to the next Sprint, team can then use Quire‚Äôs filter function to display only the items that are of immediate concern:                 A Product Backlog should not only contain fragmented user stories   rather, it should speak the whole vision your team has for the product. Coarse requirements better portray value and as we develop them into finer items, they branch into items that are more tangible so we can assess their cost more accurately. A tree structure naturally capture this branching and retains information encoded in both, and as a whole.   We&#39;ve only tapped into how Quire can help us to reinvent the Product Backlog. We‚Äôll explore how Quire can be used to deal with other aspects of Scrum in subsequent articles. Until then, please give Quire a try and let us know what you think.  ",

        "title": "Quire‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA design hiding complexity in simplicity",
        "excerpt": "    Previously on Quire‚Ä¶    In my previous blog post, I have mentioned how the simplicity of UI makes up one of the most important key factors to an effective task management tool. I want to take this further and elaborate on how we came up with the design Quire looks like today.    Currently on task management tools‚Ä¶    If you are one of those people, like me, who have tried numerous task managers /to-do lists you may find yourself stuck in extreme situations like the following. Either,    Task management tools being bloated. They overwhelm users with excess choices and features you‚Äôll never use.  To-do lists that serve like digital versions of plain paper providing zero team collaboration features‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand we know how important team collaboration is!  Hierarchical approaches are rare while ones available always lack a thing or two, such as easy to change hierarchy levels, organization concept, unlimited sublists etc.     So, the ultimatum for us is to solve these problems by‚Ä¶     finding the right balance between features and simplicity hiding expert functions from beginners hiding less-used features from users making the app work AND provide a unique look &amp; feel on desktop, tablet and mobile devices providing good readability creating a simple but informative overview of organization, projects and users    After numerous discussions and mix match, we decided to go for a clearly structured layout with 3 distinct levels;            Level 1: sidebar with organizations and related projects Level 2: task list Level 3: task detail panel    Now, let‚Äôs explore into the design thinking for each of the sections;    Side bar‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike a menu   The purpose of the side bar sort of acts like a menu. Unlike a menu of a restaurant which I‚Äôm sure you would be willing to take the time to flip back and forth, it is highly unlikely you‚Äôd want to do the same to start a day of work like this every morning. To avoid this kind of hassle, we decided to show all the organization and projects you belong to at one glance instead of having to for example drop down a organization before you could see what projects are in it. Having said this, we also wanted it to keep it as simple but as the same time as informative as possible. Therefore we made the appearance of organization and projects different by giving them a different font style. For additional information we display the number of tasks next to the related project.          A sidebar showing all organization &amp; projects   We also wanted you to be able to manage organizations and projects from here; just a click away from adding organizations and projects! In this panel, we also provide an easy but subtle way to access the profile pages of your organizations and projects.     Task list‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcrystal clear tree structure   If you were a heavy user of powerpoint in high school like me, you gotta love how each slide has a title, some bullet points and sub-bullet points in each bullet point‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeverything is so crystal clear, like Aladdin and Jasmine on the magic carpet. Well, this is what is commonly known as the ‚Äútree structure‚Äù or a ‚Äúhierarchical list‚Äù which is conceptualized and used in Quire, showing all your tasks in a hierarchical order.          Crystal clear tree-structured task list   For expert users we also provide keyboard shortcuts for most task operations;          We wanted users to be able to add basic task attributes like assignee and due date here. Besides that you can also complete a task, change the name of it or see tags without having to open the detail panel.   Another feature we are trying to hide from beginners is the filter bar. Usability tests showed that beginners don‚Äôt need to group or filter tasks based on specific conditions, therefore it would only cause confusion to have the filter options present at all times. Another way to hide complexity is our unique tree structure. For a simple to-do list, you just list your tasks one after another‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsimple enough. On the other hand, if you needed to set up a complex project with top-level and sub-level tasks, you can also do that, but easily hide the complexity of it by collapsing the tree nodes giving you a nice and clean view at first glance.          Collapse your tree nodes to give a nice &amp; clean view     Task detail panel‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämeaningful communication   Obviously, not every project or task is so simple and straight forward. Sometimes, you need to add some details, references, or discuss a particular task with your colleagues‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthese are shown in the detail panel. During our design process we were trying hard to keep this as simple as possible. In the end, we achieved simplicity by the extensive use of progressive disclosure: Want to see more than the first two lines of a description? Expand it. Want to see all activities related to your task? Expand it. Want to write a comment? Click the input field and it automatically expands and gives you more options for your comment.          All details about the task can be put here   We believe that good usability is achieved by meaningful placeholders. we want to take users by the hands and help them to achieve their goals by providing placeholders like ‚Äúadd tag‚Äù, ‚Äúadd description‚Äù and ‚Äúadd comment‚Äù. Clicking either of those will bring up an input field where you can enter your values.   And this, is also where our value stands‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbe simple, be meaningful, be helpful.   Let us help you, try Quire, it‚Äôs free.     Manage your tasks naturally.  ",

        "title": "Quire: Building a Large Application with Dart",
        "excerpt": "   Quire is not the first web application written in Dart and won‚Äôt be the last one, but it could be the first app that relies on Dart so heavily, on both client and server sides.          It‚Äôs a fun task manager with tree structure to the core. The project itself has 53992 lines, 1620KB of Dart code, built with a few open source libraries from the community.   Who we are   Before we started to work on this project, we are Dart enthusiasts known as the Rikulo team, who have released several Dart libraies, including UI framework, UI library, web server, messaging server, database client, etc.   We were all excited by Dart‚Äôs future worth when Dart was first released in 2011, and right away we started to work with Dart in small fractions of projects. Eventually we moved on to build a full application that consists of Dart majorly. Here we would like to humbly shared some of our experience, hoping to give you some information about developing in Dart.   Choosing Dart   There are tons of reasons to choose Dart. Among them, the most important ones for us are:    Dart‚Äôs strong type system guards us from countless tiny mistakes. Dart Editor, the official IDE, gives quick feedbacks on type errors and auto-completions as well as easier tracing. We think the class-based inheritance model is much more intuitive than the prototype-based one. Dart offers the chance to use the same language on both client and server side, sharing the same data model as well as code base. Dart fixes most of the gotchas in JavaScript. Dart isn‚Äôt perfect on this, but it does take care of 99% of the old bad surprises. Dart has a few popular JavaScript Harmony features available today: Future (promise), Arrow Function, etc. Dart is backed up by a strong team, with many high quality official libraries and well organized APIs. Dart is still evolving but the specification is quite stable already. On server side, we prefer event loop model over multi-threading. Dart performs tree shaking when compiled to JavaScript. (See below.)   There are also cons of choosing Dart:    Dart community is way smaller than JavaScript community. Communication across Dart and JavaScript isn‚Äôt trivial. It‚Äôs harder to polyfill APIs in a strong typed language. Dart Editor performance is not optimal for large project (yet).   Embraced by strong type support, writing in Dart is much more robust than in JavaScript. Also, Dart is less verbose than Java, and sometimes (for example, with function expression) even less verbose than vanilla - - JavaScript. In general, working with Dart is comfortable, except for a few things:    Final field must be initialized at initializer, eariler than constructor body. Mixin specification is rather immature, and it won‚Äôt be fixed before 2.0. No generic type parameter for function declaration, only on class. (Of course, this will increase the workload of compiler.)   Client side   Before Dart VM lands on Chrome, you would expect to deliver your product by compiling it to JavaScript. There are tons of languages which compile to JavaScript, but Dart stands out with a few extra advantages.    In development, we run Dart natively on Dartium, a browser forked from Chormium with a built in Dart VM. We don‚Äôt need to compile in this iteration, exempting us from countless interuptions. In tests and production, we compile them to JavaScript and run with all major browsers. The Dart-to-JavaScript compiler performs tree shaking, which trims off unused code from the outcome. This greatly reduces our JavaScript code size.   Server side   Dart on server side was never a hot topic in the Dart community, but we consider Dart as a strong candidate for server side programming language, because:    Web service, by its asynchronous nature, works very well with event loop model (over multi-threading). Server side code demands much more robustness and security than client. A strong-typed language really comes in handy on this.   Supporting libraries   Quire is built with around 30 library imports, and of which 10 come from the community, while the rest are released by Dart team. While you may guess there are AngularDART and Polymer.dart if you are a Dart expert, they are actually both absent.   We are not using AngularDART, because:    We want delicate DOM control. We use unique architectural guidelines to design the client structure, and the paradigm is different from the Angular logic. When we surveyed AngularDART it generated a large overhead on compiled JavaScript code size, but this has been greatly improved.   We are not using Polymer.dart either, because:    Due to encapsulation and event re-targeting, ShadowDOM can‚Äôt collaborate with selector oriented framework, for example, Bootstrap. You can‚Äôt inject style from the outside of ShadowDOM. If a 3rd party component set is made of Polymer, it‚Äôs almost impossible for users to change its look-and-feel. Updated: As of Dec 2013, you can modify internal style from the outside. See Shadow DOM 201.   DQuery &amp; Bootjack   The cornerstones of our client side stack are DQuery and Bootjack, which are both open source projects released by the Rikulo team:    DQuery is a partial porting of jQuery to Dart, focusing on the event delegation system of jQuery. Bootjack is a complete porting of Bootstrap 3, with almost identical CSS and APIs.   We built our application stack along this way to leverage our knowledge and skills from the JavaScript world.   Stream   Stream is our web server, written in pure Dart, equipped with the abilities of routing, filter, server side MVC, etc. Stream works seamlessly with the event loop model. Writing a request handler is just about chaining a sequence of non-blocking routines. It is not only more productive and also more pleasure to work with than traditional multi-threading model. We also scale our web service and handle HTTPS with nginx, and delegate requests to Stream. With this architecture we are able to spawn and despawn Dart VM individually and upgrade the server without interupting user activities.   Conclusion   We have an enjoyable experience working with Dart, and we are looking forward to more exciting developments in the Dart community. Last but not least, if you are curious about what you can achieve with Dart, come and play with our app, Quire. It‚Äôs free!         ",

        "title": "Why We Abandoned the To-Do List",
        "excerpt": "   Central to most task management software is a conventional to-do list that stores all conceivable tasks. But a to-do list was never meant to handle the intricacy hidden in tasks which warrants the governance of a task management system.      What purpose does a to-do list serve?    We start writing tasks down when there are too many of them for us to manage them well. Tasks can be better prioritized and tracked for their completion in a written or visual form so they become ‚Äútangible‚Äù in a way. Simply put, a to-do list helps us to remember (track) and compare (rank) our tasks.      But to-do lists fail to serve their purpose under certain conditions.    As the number of tasks grows, looking at an extended list does not help us much in comparing and prioritizing tasks. The result is a long list of tasks that appear to be equally important. With a sheer number of equally important tasks on the list, it once again becomes difficult to track and rank our tasks.   When we put down ‚Äúincomparable‚Äù tasks forming a heterogeneous list, we make the tasks difficult to compare or rank. Tasks are ‚Äúincomparable‚Äù in the sense that they vary too greatly in their scope and context; hence comparing or ranking them makes no sense.   For instance, if we have both ‚ÄúRead n pages of Book X‚Äù and ‚ÄúGet a Pilot License‚Äù on our to-do list, they‚Äôll only become comparable if we understand the context which the reading task belongs. Suppose, we recall that a ‚Äúproject due tomorrow‚Äù would require that we first digest the material on those n pages in Book X, we can then weigh in on the priority between ‚Äúproject due tomorrow‚Äù and ‚ÄúGet a Pilot License‚Äù. A heterogeneous list therefore requires us to remember all the contexts associated with each task which would prove to be difficult.   Without exhaustively considering all possible ways to falsify the usefulness of to-do lists, let‚Äôs note that a to-do list no longer suffice when the number of tasks is large enough to render them equally important or when the list becomes heterogeneous.      Do the tasks we put down in our conventional task management systems collide with these limitations?    A task with a large scope and long duration inevitably is required to be broken down into more manageable action items so they can be executed. While some large tasks are broken down and expanded, there will be others which would not have proceeded to that stage of their life cycle, and hence we inadvertently created a heterogeneous list. Confusion will arise until all tasks are broken down into a state of homogeneity within the list. By then, the inflated to-do list would become an extensively long list of equally important tasks. Tasks that require the governance of a task management system often have a large scope and a long duration. Entering tasks as such into a conventional to-do list will inevitably render it heterogeneous and the tasks will eventually evolve to bear equal importance; which implicitly reduces their importance.      How do task management software deal with to-do list‚Äôs limitations?    Given these limitations, the prevalent solution is to divide the primordial to-do list into several other lists. For instance, the ‚Äúsibling‚Äù tasks are often placed into nother list called ‚Äúsub-tasks‚Äù whereas the ‚Äúparent‚Äù tasks may be designated to a list of ‚Äúsections‚Äù or other synonyms.   A more flexible system may allow a sub-task to bear sub-tasks of its own which effectively is attaching another list to itself indefinitely. This scheme produces a hierarchical structure as depicted below:          Having the flexibility to attach another list of sub-tasks to any given task or another sub-task ensures that we can always ‚Äúzoom-in‚Äù and break down on a task. This process gives rise to a hierarchy which in turn indicates their dependencies. Therefore we&#39;ve eliminated the problem of a flat list of equally important tasks. And because **we now have a hierarchy of tasks, we can organize tasks as such that *we can achieve homogeneity for each level of tasks**.      But how do you convey nested task lists?    Even though the most flexible task management tools would allow a structure of an indefinite hierarchy but showing nested lists is just not practical from a UI design perspective.   But without showing all tasks along the hierarchy, we easily would lose the context that‚Äôs required to monitor a task. Take the following task structure for example:          ‚ÄúGet Report B2‚Äì1&quot; under ‚ÄúComplete A‚Äù requires that ‚ÄúDo Report B2‚Äì1&quot; under ‚ÄúComplete B‚Äù is done. But due to the constraints in showing nested lists, a compromised view would show:          or          screenshots were taken from Asana   In either case, we‚Äôd completely miss the dependency that ‚ÄúReview A3&quot; has on ‚ÄúDo B2&quot;, since it belongs to a list of subtasks hidden in view. Neither view conveys the context which would rather indicate that one sub-task of one task hierarchy depends on that of another. Essentially, what users see is still to-do lists in their primordial form, but now in multiples, without presenting tasks‚Äô context and relations.     Our solution is to preserve tasks‚Äô natural hierarchy in a tree structure          The problem of linking lists together to form the necessary hierarchy is that lists are kept as separate entities. Showing how many lists necessary to convey the context is not feasible given the constraints in a user interface.   Instead, we recognized that this hierarchy would be better represented with a tree structure. Each sub-task becomes a child node of a task. When a task is retrieved, so are all the parent and children task nodes that make up the entire context.   Under this structure, tasks and their dependencies are clearly presented in the task management system.          A task may start out as a rough goal without a plan or the background knowledge to seek to its completion. The necessary steps in accomplishing the goal only come to existence through more thoughts and collaboration.   As we plan and organize our tasks as they progress, tasks represented as tree nodes can be easily re-arranged in accordance with their dependencies by drag-n-drop as depicted below:          To avoid tasks cluttering our view and lose our focus, we can simply collapse the task tree that are irrelevant to our immediate tasks at hand.     The to-do list helps us to make our goals more ‚Äútangible‚Äù but it was never meant to become the backbone of task management software.   Nested to-do lists provides the logical hierarchy to accommodate more complex tasks, such as those we find in a project which requires team work and collaboration. But nested lists are still separate lists which divide a task‚Äôs context, nor can this context be displayed effectively in a user interface.   We see that a tree structure‚Äôs hierarchy naturally captures how tasks evolve through their life cycle. It provides a bird‚Äôs eye view of tasks‚Äô relationships. A Task Tree serves as a better backbone to a task management system. We‚Äôd love to know if this idea works for you; give the task tree a try.  ",

You want all the necessary features but without all the unnecessary features that would complicate the UI, or slow down the performance. Imagine managing your tasks in a turtle speed, I don‚Äôt know about you, but I would definitely go crazy. Find one that balances your needs.   A good task management tool should not only provide a list of tasks you don‚Äôt want to forget, it should also have 3 things ‚Äî    time collaboration. visual hierarchy of tasks and, simplicity in the UI.   Let‚Äôs take ‚ÄúQuire‚Äù as an example and see how it can transform the way you do things to help you and your team to achieve more work, in less time.   Needless to say, team work is very important. It is the key to successful projects which ultimately leads to a successful company. In order to do this, traditionally we have meetings, meetings AND more meetings which can be both physically and mentally draining, not to mention time wasting. And when there‚Äôs a tiny little change in the project or on a particular task, this will happen all over again! To make your life easier, real time collaboration and notification is essential for a dynamic team project that may change at any second.   In Quire, comments of your team members, file attachments, any changes made to tasks are notified in real time working pretty similarly to Facebook notifications. Like you don‚Äôt want to miss a comment from your friend, you also don‚Äôt want to miss an important piece of information from your project members. You can also see who‚Äôs currently online working on the same project as you so you can cue them for immediate response.          Visual hierarchy of tasks. This is something more rare and less found in the market which is rather surprising considering its importance. As the actual executor of the tasks, we don‚Äôt just want a list of to-dos, it is important that we can visually see the relationship and hierarchy between tasks. Quire has made this possible by introducing the tree structure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe fundamental pattern we see everywhere in nature. Like how an idea spawns more ideas, a task may lead to several sub-tasks, Quire replicates how the human minds work into the app‚Äôs workflow. Your team can easily work your way through completing a big task by dividing it into sub-tasks and assigning them to different people.          Simplicity in the UI (user interface). This is just about as important as water is to fish and air is to you. Easier said than done, most task management tools have appalling complicated UIs to accommodate the many features they provide. But is complexity of UI really proportional to features? The answer is NO. After all, what‚Äôs the point of all those good features if you can‚Äôt know where to find them?   Quire has a succinct and elegant UI providing you great user experience. You can easily find where to edit your profile, filter your tasks, who‚Äôs assigned to what, whether or not there is an urgent task to do, comments of your colleagues, files attached etc. all in a spacious design. You won‚Äôt have to make vigorous eye movements to find a particular task. Like Leonardo da Vinci said ‚Äúsimplicity is the ultimate sophistication‚Äù.          So now, it is time to chuck out that piece of paper of yours or leave that un-user friendly task management tool you‚Äôre currently tolerating and start finding yourself and your team a suitable task management tool! Increased productivity, efficiency and performance will come closer to you by the day. Good luck!   I also recommend you to try Quire, it‚Äôs free!     Be Green. Be Smart. Be Collaborative.  ",
