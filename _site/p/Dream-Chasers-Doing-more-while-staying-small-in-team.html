<p>For many of us, the biggest challenge is to stay productive and organized as our team grows bigger and bigger. But it is the opposite for Ray.</p>

<p>Ray works as a senior software engineer in <a href="https://www.avinc.com/">Aerovironment, Inc.</a>, a technology company located in California, United States. For him, the question is how to get more things done in a team that shrinked from 12 to 4-5 people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I found myself having to do many things simultaneously. But Quire has helped me prioritize with my work so I do not feel stressed.”<br>
-- Ray<br>
Senior Software Engineer of Aerovironment, Inc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I spoke to Ray about how Quire has helped him stay away from chaos and pressure. Here is the interview in a nutshell.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-quire">How did you find out about Quire?</h2>

<p>Years ago, I used to use a PIM software called <a href="http://eccopro.com/">ECCO Pro</a>. The thing I liked about it was that it allowed you to set up hierarchical to-do lists which is exactly how I think about my work. It seemed no other software did that at the time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the company went out of business. So I did a search to find a “<strong>hierarchical todo list</strong>” software, and <a href="https://quire.io/">Quire</a> was what I found.</p>

<h2 id="was-there-any-problem-or-challenge-before-you-started-using-quire">Was there any problem or challenge before you started using Quire?</h2>

<p>Yes, there definitely was.</p>

<p>As our team got smaller, I found myself having to manage many projects at the same time, and trying to remember where I was in each one.</p>

<p>It was very difficult to stay organized, when your to-do list kept growing.</p>

<h2 id="mind-telling-us-how-has-quire-helped-you-then">Mind telling us how has Quire helped you then?</h2>

<p>I have been using Quire now for about 2 months now. It has helped me a great deal.</p>

<p>For example, it has helped me to <strong>prioritize my work and remember where I am in projects that I have to move away from and come back to</strong>. It has also helped me discipline myself to write things down, so I don’t feel stressed trying to keep everything in my head.</p>

<p>I use the tree structure to indicate dependencies - subtasks must be completed before their parent task is done.</p>

<h2 id="lastly-anything-you-would-like-to-say-to-the-quire-team">Lastly, anything you would like to say to the Quire team?</h2>

<p>Recently, I have begun adding tasks for my team members, inviting them to join Quire and asking them to check off tasks after completing them.</p>

<p>I believe eventually, Quire might just become the perfect team coordination tool - what it is especially designed to be - for us.</p>
